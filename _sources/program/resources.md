# On/Off Campus Resources

## Housing
* Specific housing assignments will be sent shortly before the start of the program, but all in-person students will be provided a room in a campus dorm/apartment.
* The apartments come furnished with beds, couches, end tables, trash cans, desks, lamps, stoves, refrigerators, tables and chairs.
* Linens (1 sheet set, 1 blanket, 1 pillow, and 1 set of towels per person) will be provided. There is a full kitchen but you may want to bring dishes, eating utensils, pots, and pans. We recommend students bring their laptop computers, if you have one. Otherwise, computers are accessible from campus libraries. We will also provide housing assignments the week before you travel so that you can coordinate with your roommates.
* A general cleaning service is provided. Custodians will clean your bathrooms and kitchen area once per week. However, they will not wash your dishes. They will also change your linens once per week.
