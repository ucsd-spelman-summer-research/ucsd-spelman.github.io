# # P02: Control flow and logic
# 
# Computer programs become very powerful once we can command their flow of execution.  This is done via two primary control structures:
# 
# - Conditionals (`if...elif...else`) statements that allow the program execution to *branch* based on conditions that are met, and
# - Loops (`for` and `while`) that allow the program execution to *repeat* either a fixed number of times (`for` loops) or until some condition is met (`while` loops).
# 
# - Overview of topics:
#     - conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
#     - comparison operators
#     - logic operators
#     - for loops
#     - while loops
