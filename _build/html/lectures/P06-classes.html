<div class="output stream highlight-myst-ansi notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>[&#39;It was on a dreary night of November that I beheld the accomplishment\n&#39;, &#39;of my toils. With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I\n&#39;, &#39;collected the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a\n&#39;, &#39;spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet. It was\n&#39;, &#39;already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the\n&#39;, &#39;panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the\n&#39;, &#39;half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature\n&#39;, &#39;open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate\n&#39;, &#39;the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavoured to\n&#39;, &#39;form? His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as\n&#39;, &#39;beautiful. Beautiful! Great God! His yellow skin scarcely covered\n&#39;, &#39;the work of muscles and arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous\n&#39;, &#39;black, and flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these\n&#39;, &#39;luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes,\n&#39;, &#39;that seemed almost of the same colour as the dun-white sockets in which\n&#39;, &#39;they were set, his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings\n&#39;, &#39;of human nature. I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole\n&#39;, &#39;purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had\n&#39;, &#39;deprived myself of rest and health. I had desired it with an ardour\n&#39;, &#39;that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty\n&#39;, &#39;of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my\n&#39;, &#39;heart. Unable to endure the aspect of the being I had created, I\n&#39;, &#39;rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my\n&#39;, &#39;bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep. At length lassitude\n&#39;, &#39;succeeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the\n&#39;, &#39;bed in my clothes, endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness.\n&#39;, &#39;But it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest\n&#39;, &#39;dreams. I thought I saw Elizabeth, in the bloom of health, walking in\n&#39;, &#39;the streets of Ingolstadt. Delighted and surprised, I embraced her,\n&#39;, &#39;but as I imprinted the first kiss on her lips, they became livid with\n&#39;, &#39;the hue of death; her features appeared to change, and I thought that I\n&#39;, &#39;held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms; a shroud enveloped her\n&#39;, &#39;form, and I saw the grave-worms crawling in the folds of the flannel.\n&#39;, &#39;I started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my\n&#39;, &#39;teeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and\n&#39;, &#39;yellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window\n&#39;, &#39;shutters, I beheld the wretch—the miserable monster whom I had\n&#39;, &#39;created. He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they\n&#39;, &#39;may be called, were fixed on me. His jaws opened, and he muttered some\n&#39;, &#39;inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks. He might have\n&#39;, &#39;spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to\n&#39;, &#39;detain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs. I took refuge in the\n&#39;, &#39;courtyard belonging to the house which I inhabited, where I remained\n&#39;, &#39;during the rest of the night, walking up and down in the greatest\n&#39;, &#39;agitation, listening attentively, catching and fearing each sound as if\n&#39;, &#39;it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which I\n&#39;, &#39;had so miserably given life.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Oh! No mortal could support the horror of that countenance. A mummy\n&#39;, &#39;again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch. I\n&#39;, &#39;had gazed on him while unfinished; he was ugly then, but when those\n&#39;, &#39;muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion, it became a thing\n&#39;, &#39;such as even Dante could not have conceived.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I passed the night wretchedly. Sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and\n&#39;, &#39;hardly that I felt the palpitation of every artery; at others, I nearly\n&#39;, &#39;sank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness. Mingled with\n&#39;, &#39;this horror, I felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams that had\n&#39;, &#39;been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a\n&#39;, &#39;hell to me; and the change was so rapid, the overthrow so complete!\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Morning, dismal and wet, at length dawned and discovered to my\n&#39;, &#39;sleepless and aching eyes the church of Ingolstadt, its white steeple\n&#39;, &#39;and clock, which indicated the sixth hour. The porter opened the gates\n&#39;, &#39;of the court, which had that night been my asylum, and I issued into\n&#39;, &#39;the streets, pacing them with quick steps, as if I sought to avoid the\n&#39;, &#39;wretch whom I feared every turning of the street would present to my\n&#39;, &#39;view. I did not dare return to the apartment which I inhabited, but\n&#39;, &#39;felt impelled to hurry on, although drenched by the rain which poured\n&#39;, &#39;from a black and comfortless sky.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring by\n&#39;, &#39;bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I\n&#39;, &#39;traversed the streets without any clear conception of where I was or\n&#39;, &#39;what I was doing. My heart palpitated in the sickness of fear, and I\n&#39;, &#39;hurried on with irregular steps, not daring to look about me:\n&#39;, &#39; \n&#39;, &#39; Like one who, on a lonely road,\n&#39;, &#39; Doth walk in fear and dread,\n&#39;, &#39; And, having once turned round, walks on,\n&#39;, &#39; And turns no more his head;\n&#39;, &#39; Because he knows a frightful fiend\n&#39;, &#39; Doth close behind him tread.\n&#39;, &#39; \n&#39;, &#39; [Coleridge’s “Ancient Mariner.”]\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Continuing thus, I came at length opposite to the inn at which the various\n&#39;, &#39;diligences and carriages usually stopped. Here I paused, I knew not why;\n&#39;, &#39;but I remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming\n&#39;, &#39;towards me from the other end of the street. As it drew nearer I observed\n&#39;, &#39;that it was the Swiss diligence; it stopped just where I was standing, and\n&#39;, &#39;on the door being opened, I perceived Henry Clerval, who, on seeing me,\n&#39;, &#39;instantly sprung out. “My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed he,\n&#39;, &#39;“how glad I am to see you! How fortunate that you should be here at\n&#39;, &#39;the very moment of my alighting!”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Nothing could equal my delight on seeing Clerval; his presence brought back\n&#39;, &#39;to my thoughts my father, Elizabeth, and all those scenes of home so dear\n&#39;, &#39;to my recollection. I grasped his hand, and in a moment forgot my horror\n&#39;, &#39;and misfortune; I felt suddenly, and for the first time during many months,\n&#39;, &#39;calm and serene joy. I welcomed my friend, therefore, in the most cordial\n&#39;, &#39;manner, and we walked towards my college. Clerval continued talking for\n&#39;, &#39;some time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being\n&#39;, &#39;permitted to come to Ingolstadt. “You may easily believe,” said\n&#39;, &#39;he, “how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all\n&#39;, &#39;necessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of book-keeping;\n&#39;, &#39;and, indeed, I believe I left him incredulous to the last, for his constant\n&#39;, &#39;answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the Dutch\n&#39;, &#39;schoolmaster in The Vicar of Wakefield: ‘I have ten thousand florins\n&#39;, &#39;a year without Greek, I eat heartily without Greek.’ But his\n&#39;, &#39;affection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning, and he has\n&#39;, &#39;permitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of\n&#39;, &#39;knowledge.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“It gives me the greatest delight to see you; but tell me how you left\n&#39;, &#39;my father, brothers, and Elizabeth.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Very well, and very happy, only a little uneasy that they hear from\n&#39;, &#39;you so seldom. By the by, I mean to lecture you a little upon their\n&#39;, &#39;account myself. But, my dear Frankenstein,” continued he, stopping\n&#39;, &#39;short and gazing full in my face, “I did not before remark how very ill\n&#39;, &#39;you appear; so thin and pale; you look as if you had been watching for\n&#39;, &#39;several nights.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“You have guessed right; I have lately been so deeply engaged in one\n&#39;, &#39;occupation that I have not allowed myself sufficient rest, as you see;\n&#39;, &#39;but I hope, I sincerely hope, that all these employments are now at an\n&#39;, &#39;end and that I am at length free.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I trembled excessively; I could not endure to think of, and far less to\n&#39;, &#39;allude to, the occurrences of the preceding night. I walked with a\n&#39;, &#39;quick pace, and we soon arrived at my college. I then reflected, and\n&#39;, &#39;the thought made me shiver, that the creature whom I had left in my\n&#39;, &#39;apartment might still be there, alive and walking about. I dreaded to\n&#39;, &#39;behold this monster, but I feared still more that Henry should see him.\n&#39;, &#39;Entreating him, therefore, to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the\n&#39;, &#39;stairs, I darted up towards my own room. My hand was already on the\n&#39;, &#39;lock of the door before I recollected myself. I then paused, and a\n&#39;, &#39;cold shivering came over me. I threw the door forcibly open, as\n&#39;, &#39;children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in\n&#39;, &#39;waiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared. I stepped\n&#39;, &#39;fearfully in: the apartment was empty, and my bedroom was also freed\n&#39;, &#39;from its hideous guest. I could hardly believe that so great a good\n&#39;, &#39;fortune could have befallen me, but when I became assured that my enemy\n&#39;, &#39;had indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy and ran down to Clerval.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast;\n&#39;, &#39;but I was unable to contain myself. It was not joy only that possessed\n&#39;, &#39;me; I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse\n&#39;, &#39;beat rapidly. I was unable to remain for a single instant in the same\n&#39;, &#39;place; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud.\n&#39;, &#39;Clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival,\n&#39;, &#39;but when he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes\n&#39;, &#39;for which he could not account, and my loud, unrestrained, heartless\n&#39;, &#39;laughter frightened and astonished him.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“My dear Victor,” cried he, “what, for God’s sake,\n&#39;, &#39;is the matter? Do not laugh in that manner. How ill you are! What is the\n&#39;, &#39;cause of all this?”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Do not ask me,” cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I\n&#39;, &#39;thought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; “_he_ can\n&#39;, &#39;tell. Oh, save me! Save me!” I imagined that the monster seized me;\n&#39;, &#39;I struggled furiously and fell down in a fit.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Poor Clerval! What must have been his feelings? A meeting, which he\n&#39;, &#39;anticipated with such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness. But I\n&#39;, &#39;was not the witness of his grief, for I was lifeless and did not\n&#39;, &#39;recover my senses for a long, long time.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;This was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for\n&#39;, &#39;several months. During all that time Henry was my only nurse. I\n&#39;, &#39;afterwards learned that, knowing my father’s advanced age and unfitness\n&#39;, &#39;for so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make\n&#39;, &#39;Elizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my\n&#39;, &#39;disorder. He knew that I could not have a more kind and attentive\n&#39;, &#39;nurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, he\n&#39;, &#39;did not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest\n&#39;, &#39;action that he could towards them.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;But I was in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the unbounded and\n&#39;, &#39;unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life.\n&#39;, &#39;The form of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was for ever\n&#39;, &#39;before my eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him. Doubtless my\n&#39;, &#39;words surprised Henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderings\n&#39;, &#39;of my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which I\n&#39;, &#39;continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder\n&#39;, &#39;indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and\n&#39;, &#39;grieved my friend, I recovered. I remember the first time I became\n&#39;, &#39;capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I\n&#39;, &#39;perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young\n&#39;, &#39;buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window. It was\n&#39;, &#39;a divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my\n&#39;, &#39;convalescence. I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in\n&#39;, &#39;my bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time I became as\n&#39;, &#39;cheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Dearest Clerval,” exclaimed I, “how kind, how very good\n&#39;, &#39;you are to me. This whole winter, instead of being spent in study, as you\n&#39;, &#39;promised yourself, has been consumed in my sick room. How shall I ever\n&#39;, &#39;repay you? I feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which I\n&#39;, &#39;have been the occasion, but you will forgive me.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“You will repay me entirely if you do not discompose yourself, but get\n&#39;, &#39;well as fast as you can; and since you appear in such good spirits, I\n&#39;, &#39;may speak to you on one subject, may I not?”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I trembled. One subject! What could it be? Could he allude to an object on\n&#39;, &#39;whom I dared not even think?\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Compose yourself,” said Clerval, who observed my change of\n&#39;, &#39;colour, “I will not mention it if it agitates you; but your father\n&#39;, &#39;and cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your\n&#39;, &#39;own handwriting. They hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy at\n&#39;, &#39;your long silence.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Is that all, my dear Henry? How could you suppose that my first\n&#39;, &#39;thought would not fly towards those dear, dear friends whom I love and\n&#39;, &#39;who are so deserving of my love?”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“If this is your present temper, my friend, you will perhaps be glad\n&#39;, &#39;to see a letter that has been lying here some days for you; it is from\n&#39;, &#39;your cousin, I believe.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Chapter 6\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Clerval then put the following letter into my hands. It was from my\n&#39;, &#39;own Elizabeth:\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“My dearest Cousin,\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“You have been ill, very ill, and even the constant letters of dear\n&#39;, &#39;kind Henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account. You are\n&#39;, &#39;forbidden to write—to hold a pen; yet one word from you, dear Victor,\n&#39;, &#39;is necessary to calm our apprehensions. For a long time I have thought\n&#39;, &#39;that each post would bring this line, and my persuasions have\n&#39;, &#39;restrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to Ingolstadt. I have\n&#39;, &#39;prevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so\n&#39;, &#39;long a journey, yet how often have I regretted not being able to\n&#39;, &#39;perform it myself! I figure to myself that the task of attending on\n&#39;, &#39;your sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse, who could never\n&#39;, &#39;guess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of\n&#39;, &#39;your poor cousin. Yet that is over now: Clerval writes that indeed\n&#39;, &#39;you are getting better. I eagerly hope that you will confirm this\n&#39;, &#39;intelligence soon in your own handwriting.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Get well—and return to us. You will find a happy, cheerful home and\n&#39;, &#39;friends who love you dearly. Your father’s health is vigorous, and he\n&#39;, &#39;asks but to see you, but to be assured that you are well; and not a\n&#39;, &#39;care will ever cloud his benevolent countenance. How pleased you would\n&#39;, &#39;be to remark the improvement of our Ernest! He is now sixteen and full\n&#39;, &#39;of activity and spirit. He is desirous to be a true Swiss and to enter\n&#39;, &#39;into foreign service, but we cannot part with him, at least until his\n&#39;, &#39;elder brother returns to us. My uncle is not pleased with the idea of\n&#39;, &#39;a military career in a distant country, but Ernest never had your\n&#39;, &#39;powers of application. He looks upon study as an odious fetter; his\n&#39;, &#39;time is spent in the open air, climbing the hills or rowing on the\n&#39;, &#39;lake. I fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point\n&#39;, &#39;and permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Little alteration, except the growth of our dear children, has taken\n&#39;, &#39;place since you left us. The blue lake and snow-clad mountains—they\n&#39;, &#39;never change; and I think our placid home and our contented hearts are\n&#39;, &#39;regulated by the same immutable laws. My trifling occupations take up\n&#39;, &#39;my time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for any exertions by seeing\n&#39;, &#39;none but happy, kind faces around me. Since you left us, but one\n&#39;, &#39;change has taken place in our little household. Do you remember on\n&#39;, &#39;what occasion Justine Moritz entered our family? Probably you do not;\n&#39;, &#39;I will relate her history, therefore in a few words. Madame Moritz,\n&#39;, &#39;her mother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was the\n&#39;, &#39;third. This girl had always been the favourite of her father, but\n&#39;, &#39;through a strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, and\n&#39;, &#39;after the death of M. Moritz, treated her very ill. My aunt observed\n&#39;, &#39;this, and when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother\n&#39;, &#39;to allow her to live at our house. The republican institutions of our\n&#39;, &#39;country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which\n&#39;, &#39;prevail in the great monarchies that surround it. Hence there is less\n&#39;, &#39;distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the\n&#39;, &#39;lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are\n&#39;, &#39;more refined and moral. A servant in Geneva does not mean the same\n&#39;, &#39;thing as a servant in France and England. Justine, thus received in\n&#39;, &#39;our family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our\n&#39;, &#39;fortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance and a\n&#39;, &#39;sacrifice of the dignity of a human being.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Justine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and I\n&#39;, &#39;recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one\n&#39;, &#39;glance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that\n&#39;, &#39;Ariosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelica—she looked so\n&#39;, &#39;frank-hearted and happy. My aunt conceived a great attachment for her,\n&#39;, &#39;by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that\n&#39;, &#39;which she had at first intended. This benefit was fully repaid;\n&#39;, &#39;Justine was the most grateful little creature in the world: I do not\n&#39;, &#39;mean that she made any professions I never heard one pass her lips, but\n&#39;, &#39;you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress.\n&#39;, &#39;Although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate,\n&#39;, &#39;yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt. She\n&#39;, &#39;thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her\n&#39;, &#39;phraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“When my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own\n&#39;, &#39;grief to notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illness\n&#39;, &#39;with the most anxious affection. Poor Justine was very ill; but other\n&#39;, &#39;trials were reserved for her.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“One by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the\n&#39;, &#39;exception of her neglected daughter, was left childless. The\n&#39;, &#39;conscience of the woman was troubled; she began to think that the\n&#39;, &#39;deaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her\n&#39;, &#39;partiality. She was a Roman Catholic; and I believe her confessor\n&#39;, &#39;confirmed the idea which she had conceived. Accordingly, a few months\n&#39;, &#39;after your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her\n&#39;, &#39;repentant mother. Poor girl! She wept when she quitted our house; she\n&#39;, &#39;was much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness\n&#39;, &#39;and a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable\n&#39;, &#39;for vivacity. Nor was her residence at her mother’s house of a nature\n&#39;, &#39;to restore her gaiety. The poor woman was very vacillating in her\n&#39;, &#39;repentance. She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness,\n&#39;, &#39;but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her\n&#39;, &#39;brothers and sister. Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritz\n&#39;, &#39;into a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is\n&#39;, &#39;now at peace for ever. She died on the first approach of cold weather,\n&#39;, &#39;at the beginning of this last winter. Justine has just returned to us;\n&#39;, &#39;and I assure you I love her tenderly. She is very clever and gentle,\n&#39;, &#39;and extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien and her\n&#39;, &#39;expression continually remind me of my dear aunt.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I must say also a few words to you, my dear cousin, of little darling\n&#39;, &#39;William. I wish you could see him; he is very tall of his age, with\n&#39;, &#39;sweet laughing blue eyes, dark eyelashes, and curling hair. When he\n&#39;, &#39;smiles, two little dimples appear on each cheek, which are rosy with\n&#39;, &#39;health. He has already had one or two little _wives,_ but Louisa Biron\n&#39;, &#39;is his favourite, a pretty little girl of five years of age.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Now, dear Victor, I dare say you wish to be indulged in a little\n&#39;, &#39;gossip concerning the good people of Geneva. The pretty Miss Mansfield\n&#39;, &#39;has already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching\n&#39;, &#39;marriage with a young Englishman, John Melbourne, Esq. Her ugly\n&#39;, &#39;sister, Manon, married M. Duvillard, the rich banker, last autumn. Your\n&#39;, &#39;favourite schoolfellow, Louis Manoir, has suffered several misfortunes\n&#39;, &#39;since the departure of Clerval from Geneva. But he has already\n&#39;, &#39;recovered his spirits, and is reported to be on the point of marrying a\n&#39;, &#39;lively pretty Frenchwoman, Madame Tavernier. She is a widow, and much\n&#39;, &#39;older than Manoir; but she is very much admired, and a favourite with\n&#39;, &#39;everybody.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I have written myself into better spirits, dear cousin; but my anxiety\n&#39;, &#39;returns upon me as I conclude. Write, dearest Victor,—one line—one\n&#39;, &#39;word will be a blessing to us. Ten thousand thanks to Henry for his\n&#39;, &#39;kindness, his affection, and his many letters; we are sincerely\n&#39;, &#39;grateful. Adieu! my cousin; take care of yourself; and, I entreat\n&#39;, &#39;you, write!\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Elizabeth Lavenza.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Geneva, March 18th, 17—.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Dear, dear Elizabeth!” I exclaimed, when I had read her\n&#39;, &#39;letter: “I will write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety\n&#39;, &#39;they must feel.” I wrote, and this exertion greatly fatigued me; but\n&#39;, &#39;my convalescence had commenced, and proceeded regularly. In another\n&#39;, &#39;fortnight I was able to leave my chamber.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;One of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce Clerval to the\n&#39;, &#39;several professors of the university. In doing this, I underwent a\n&#39;, &#39;kind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had\n&#39;, &#39;sustained. Ever since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the\n&#39;, &#39;beginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even\n&#39;, &#39;to the name of natural philosophy. When I was otherwise quite restored\n&#39;, &#39;to health, the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony\n&#39;, &#39;of my nervous symptoms. Henry saw this, and had removed all my\n&#39;, &#39;apparatus from my view. He had also changed my apartment; for he\n&#39;, &#39;perceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had\n&#39;, &#39;previously been my laboratory. But these cares of Clerval were made of\n&#39;, &#39;no avail when I visited the professors. M. Waldman inflicted torture\n&#39;, &#39;when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I\n&#39;, &#39;had made in the sciences. He soon perceived that I disliked the\n&#39;, &#39;subject; but not guessing the real cause, he attributed my feelings to\n&#39;, &#39;modesty, and changed the subject from my improvement, to the science\n&#39;, &#39;itself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out. What\n&#39;, &#39;could I do? He meant to please, and he tormented me. I felt as if he\n&#39;, &#39;had placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which\n&#39;, &#39;were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death. I\n&#39;, &#39;writhed under his words, yet dared not exhibit the pain I felt.\n&#39;, &#39;Clerval, whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the\n&#39;, &#39;sensations of others, declined the subject, alleging, in excuse, his\n&#39;, &#39;total ignorance; and the conversation took a more general turn. I\n&#39;, &#39;thanked my friend from my heart, but I did not speak. I saw plainly\n&#39;, &#39;that he was surprised, but he never attempted to draw my secret from\n&#39;, &#39;me; and although I loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence\n&#39;, &#39;that knew no bounds, yet I could never persuade myself to confide in\n&#39;, &#39;him that event which was so often present to my recollection, but which\n&#39;, &#39;I feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;M. Krempe was not equally docile; and in my condition at that time, of\n&#39;, &#39;almost insupportable sensitiveness, his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even\n&#39;, &#39;more pain than the benevolent approbation of M. Waldman. “D—n\n&#39;, &#39;the fellow!” cried he; “why, M. Clerval, I assure you he has\n&#39;, &#39;outstript us all. Ay, stare if you please; but it is nevertheless true. A\n&#39;, &#39;youngster who, but a few years ago, believed in Cornelius Agrippa as firmly\n&#39;, &#39;as in the gospel, has now set himself at the head of the university; and if\n&#39;, &#39;he is not soon pulled down, we shall all be out of countenance.—Ay,\n&#39;, &#39;ay,” continued he, observing my face expressive of suffering,\n&#39;, &#39;“M. Frankenstein is modest; an excellent quality in a young man.\n&#39;, &#39;Young men should be diffident of themselves, you know, M. Clerval: I was\n&#39;, &#39;myself when young; but that wears out in a very short time.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;M. Krempe had now commenced an eulogy on himself, which happily turned\n&#39;, &#39;the conversation from a subject that was so annoying to me.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Clerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science; and his\n&#39;, &#39;literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me. He\n&#39;, &#39;came to the university with the design of making himself complete\n&#39;, &#39;master of the oriental languages, and thus he should open a field for\n&#39;, &#39;the plan of life he had marked out for himself. Resolved to pursue no\n&#39;, &#39;inglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affording\n&#39;, &#39;scope for his spirit of enterprise. The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit\n&#39;, &#39;languages engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on\n&#39;, &#39;the same studies. Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I\n&#39;, &#39;wished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt\n&#39;, &#39;great relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not\n&#39;, &#39;only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists. I\n&#39;, &#39;did not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for\n&#39;, &#39;I did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary\n&#39;, &#39;amusement. I read merely to understand their meaning, and they well\n&#39;, &#39;repaid my labours. Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy\n&#39;, &#39;elevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of\n&#39;, &#39;any other country. When you read their writings, life appears to\n&#39;, &#39;consist in a warm sun and a garden of roses,—in the smiles and frowns\n&#39;, &#39;of a fair enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart. How\n&#39;, &#39;different from the manly and heroical poetry of Greece and Rome!\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Summer passed away in these occupations, and my return to Geneva was\n&#39;, &#39;fixed for the latter end of autumn; but being delayed by several\n&#39;, &#39;accidents, winter and snow arrived, the roads were deemed impassable,\n&#39;, &#39;and my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring. I felt this\n&#39;, &#39;delay very bitterly; for I longed to see my native town and my beloved\n&#39;, &#39;friends. My return had only been delayed so long, from an\n&#39;, &#39;unwillingness to leave Clerval in a strange place, before he had become\n&#39;, &#39;acquainted with any of its inhabitants. The winter, however, was spent\n&#39;, &#39;cheerfully; and although the spring was uncommonly late, when it came\n&#39;, &#39;its beauty compensated for its dilatoriness.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;The month of May had already commenced, and I expected the letter daily\n&#39;, &#39;which was to fix the date of my departure, when Henry proposed a\n&#39;, &#39;pedestrian tour in the environs of Ingolstadt, that I might bid a\n&#39;, &#39;personal farewell to the country I had so long inhabited. I acceded\n&#39;, &#39;with pleasure to this proposition: I was fond of exercise, and Clerval\n&#39;, &#39;had always been my favourite companion in the ramble of this nature\n&#39;, &#39;that I had taken among the scenes of my native country.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;We passed a fortnight in these perambulations: my health and spirits\n&#39;, &#39;had long been restored, and they gained additional strength from the\n&#39;, &#39;salubrious air I breathed, the natural incidents of our progress, and\n&#39;, &#39;the conversation of my friend. Study had before secluded me from the\n&#39;, &#39;intercourse of my fellow-creatures, and rendered me unsocial; but\n&#39;, &#39;Clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart; he again taught\n&#39;, &#39;me to love the aspect of nature, and the cheerful faces of children.\n&#39;, &#39;Excellent friend! how sincerely you did love me, and endeavour to\n&#39;, &#39;elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own. A selfish\n&#39;, &#39;pursuit had cramped and narrowed me, until your gentleness and\n&#39;, &#39;affection warmed and opened my senses; I became the same happy creature\n&#39;, &#39;who, a few years ago, loved and beloved by all, had no sorrow or care.\n&#39;, &#39;When happy, inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most\n&#39;, &#39;delightful sensations. A serene sky and verdant fields filled me with\n&#39;, &#39;ecstasy. The present season was indeed divine; the flowers of spring\n&#39;, &#39;bloomed in the hedges, while those of summer were already in bud. I\n&#39;, &#39;was undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed\n&#39;, &#39;upon me, notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off, with an\n&#39;, &#39;invincible burden.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Henry rejoiced in my gaiety, and sincerely sympathised in my feelings: he\n&#39;, &#39;exerted himself to amuse me, while he expressed the sensations that filled\n&#39;, &#39;his soul. The resources of his mind on this occasion were truly\n&#39;, &#39;astonishing: his conversation was full of imagination; and very often, in\n&#39;, &#39;imitation of the Persian and Arabic writers, he invented tales of wonderful\n&#39;, &#39;fancy and passion. At other times he repeated my favourite poems, or drew\n&#39;, &#39;me out into arguments, which he supported with great ingenuity.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;We returned to our college on a Sunday afternoon: the peasants were\n&#39;, &#39;dancing, and every one we met appeared gay and happy. My own spirits were\n&#39;, &#39;high, and I bounded along with feelings of unbridled joy and hilarity.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Chapter 7\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;On my return, I found the following letter from my father:—\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“My dear Victor,\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“You have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of\n&#39;, &#39;your return to us; and I was at first tempted to write only a few\n&#39;, &#39;lines, merely mentioning the day on which I should expect you. But\n&#39;, &#39;that would be a cruel kindness, and I dare not do it. What would be\n&#39;, &#39;your surprise, my son, when you expected a happy and glad welcome, to\n&#39;, &#39;behold, on the contrary, tears and wretchedness? And how, Victor, can\n&#39;, &#39;I relate our misfortune? Absence cannot have rendered you callous to\n&#39;, &#39;our joys and griefs; and how shall I inflict pain on my long absent\n&#39;, &#39;son? I wish to prepare you for the woeful news, but I know it is\n&#39;, &#39;impossible; even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words\n&#39;, &#39;which are to convey to you the horrible tidings.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“William is dead!—that sweet child, whose smiles delighted and warmed\n&#39;, &#39;my heart, who was so gentle, yet so gay! Victor, he is murdered!\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I will not attempt to console you; but will simply relate the\n&#39;, &#39;circumstances of the transaction.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Last Thursday (May 7th), I, my niece, and your two brothers, went to\n&#39;, &#39;walk in Plainpalais. The evening was warm and serene, and we prolonged\n&#39;, &#39;our walk farther than usual. It was already dusk before we thought of\n&#39;, &#39;returning; and then we discovered that William and Ernest, who had gone\n&#39;, &#39;on before, were not to be found. We accordingly rested on a seat until\n&#39;, &#39;they should return. Presently Ernest came, and enquired if we had seen\n&#39;, &#39;his brother; he said, that he had been playing with him, that William\n&#39;, &#39;had run away to hide himself, and that he vainly sought for him, and\n&#39;, &#39;afterwards waited for a long time, but that he did not return.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“This account rather alarmed us, and we continued to search for him\n&#39;, &#39;until night fell, when Elizabeth conjectured that he might have\n&#39;, &#39;returned to the house. He was not there. We returned again, with\n&#39;, &#39;torches; for I could not rest, when I thought that my sweet boy had\n&#39;, &#39;lost himself, and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night;\n&#39;, &#39;Elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish. About five in the morning I\n&#39;, &#39;discovered my lovely boy, whom the night before I had seen blooming and\n&#39;, &#39;active in health, stretched on the grass livid and motionless; the\n&#39;, &#39;print of the murder’s finger was on his neck.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“He was conveyed home, and the anguish that was visible in my\n&#39;, &#39;countenance betrayed the secret to Elizabeth. She was very earnest to\n&#39;, &#39;see the corpse. At first I attempted to prevent her but she persisted,\n&#39;, &#39;and entering the room where it lay, hastily examined the neck of the\n&#39;, &#39;victim, and clasping her hands exclaimed, ‘O God! I have murdered my\n&#39;, &#39;darling child!’\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“She fainted, and was restored with extreme difficulty. When she again\n&#39;, &#39;lived, it was only to weep and sigh. She told me, that that same\n&#39;, &#39;evening William had teased her to let him wear a very valuable\n&#39;, &#39;miniature that she possessed of your mother. This picture is gone, and\n&#39;, &#39;was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed. We\n&#39;, &#39;have no trace of him at present, although our exertions to discover him\n&#39;, &#39;are unremitted; but they will not restore my beloved William!\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Come, dearest Victor; you alone can console Elizabeth. She weeps\n&#39;, &#39;continually, and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death;\n&#39;, &#39;her words pierce my heart. We are all unhappy; but will not that be an\n&#39;, &#39;additional motive for you, my son, to return and be our comforter?\n&#39;, &#39;Your dear mother! Alas, Victor! I now say, Thank God she did not live\n&#39;, &#39;to witness the cruel, miserable death of her youngest darling!\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Come, Victor; not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin,\n&#39;, &#39;but with feelings of peace and gentleness, that will heal, instead of\n&#39;, &#39;festering, the wounds of our minds. Enter the house of mourning, my\n&#39;, &#39;friend, but with kindness and affection for those who love you, and not\n&#39;, &#39;with hatred for your enemies.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Your affectionate and afflicted father,\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Alphonse Frankenstein.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Geneva, May 12th, 17—.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Clerval, who had watched my countenance as I read this letter, was\n&#39;, &#39;surprised to observe the despair that succeeded the joy I at first\n&#39;, &#39;expressed on receiving new from my friends. I threw the letter on the\n&#39;, &#39;table, and covered my face with my hands.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“My dear Frankenstein,” exclaimed Henry, when he perceived me\n&#39;, &#39;weep with bitterness, “are you always to be unhappy? My dear friend,\n&#39;, &#39;what has happened?”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I motioned him to take up the letter, while I walked up and down the\n&#39;, &#39;room in the extremest agitation. Tears also gushed from the eyes of\n&#39;, &#39;Clerval, as he read the account of my misfortune.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I can offer you no consolation, my friend,” said he;\n&#39;, &#39;“your disaster is irreparable. What do you intend to do?”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“To go instantly to Geneva: come with me, Henry, to order the horses.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;During our walk, Clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation;\n&#39;, &#39;he could only express his heartfelt sympathy. “Poor William!” said he,\n&#39;, &#39;“dear lovely child, he now sleeps with his angel mother! Who that had\n&#39;, &#39;seen him bright and joyous in his young beauty, but must weep over his\n&#39;, &#39;untimely loss! To die so miserably; to feel the murderer’s grasp! How\n&#39;, &#39;much more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence! Poor little\n&#39;, &#39;fellow! one only consolation have we; his friends mourn and weep, but\n&#39;, &#39;he is at rest. The pang is over, his sufferings are at an end for ever.\n&#39;, &#39;A sod covers his gentle form, and he knows no pain. He can no longer\n&#39;, &#39;be a subject for pity; we must reserve that for his miserable\n&#39;, &#39;survivors.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets; the words\n&#39;, &#39;impressed themselves on my mind and I remembered them afterwards in\n&#39;, &#39;solitude. But now, as soon as the horses arrived, I hurried into a\n&#39;, &#39;cabriolet, and bade farewell to my friend.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;My journey was very melancholy. At first I wished to hurry on, for I longed\n&#39;, &#39;to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends; but when I\n&#39;, &#39;drew near my native town, I slackened my progress. I could hardly sustain\n&#39;, &#39;the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind. I passed through\n&#39;, &#39;scenes familiar to my youth, but which I had not seen for nearly six years.\n&#39;, &#39;How altered every thing might be during that time! One sudden and\n&#39;, &#39;desolating change had taken place; but a thousand little circumstances\n&#39;, &#39;might have by degrees worked other alterations, which, although they were\n&#39;, &#39;done more tranquilly, might not be the less decisive. Fear overcame me; I\n&#39;, &#39;dared no advance, dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble,\n&#39;, &#39;although I was unable to define them.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I remained two days at Lausanne, in this painful state of mind. I\n&#39;, &#39;contemplated the lake: the waters were placid; all around was calm; and the\n&#39;, &#39;snowy mountains, “the palaces of nature,” were not changed. By\n&#39;, &#39;degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me, and I continued my journey\n&#39;, &#39;towards Geneva.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;The road ran by the side of the lake, which became narrower as I\n&#39;, &#39;approached my native town. I discovered more distinctly the black\n&#39;, &#39;sides of Jura, and the bright summit of Mont Blanc. I wept like a\n&#39;, &#39;child. “Dear mountains! my own beautiful lake! how do you welcome your\n&#39;, &#39;wanderer? Your summits are clear; the sky and lake are blue and\n&#39;, &#39;placid. Is this to prognosticate peace, or to mock at my unhappiness?”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I fear, my friend, that I shall render myself tedious by dwelling on\n&#39;, &#39;these preliminary circumstances; but they were days of comparative\n&#39;, &#39;happiness, and I think of them with pleasure. My country, my beloved\n&#39;, &#39;country! who but a native can tell the delight I took in again\n&#39;, &#39;beholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely\n&#39;, &#39;lake!\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Yet, as I drew nearer home, grief and fear again overcame me. Night also\n&#39;, &#39;closed around; and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt still\n&#39;, &#39;more gloomily. The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and I\n&#39;, &#39;foresaw obscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched of human\n&#39;, &#39;beings. Alas! I prophesied truly, and failed only in one single\n&#39;, &#39;circumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not\n&#39;, &#39;conceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates\n&#39;, &#39;of the town were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night at\n&#39;, &#39;Secheron, a village at the distance of half a league from the city. The sky\n&#39;, &#39;was serene; and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot\n&#39;, &#39;where my poor William had been murdered. As I could not pass through the\n&#39;, &#39;town, I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais.\n&#39;, &#39;During this short voyage I saw the lightning playing on the summit of Mont\n&#39;, &#39;Blanc in the most beautiful figures. The storm appeared to approach\n&#39;, &#39;rapidly, and, on landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe its\n&#39;, &#39;progress. It advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain\n&#39;, &#39;coming slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm\n&#39;, &#39;increased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash\n&#39;, &#39;over my head. It was echoed from Salêve, the Juras, and the Alps of\n&#39;, &#39;Savoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the\n&#39;, &#39;lake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant\n&#39;, &#39;every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself\n&#39;, &#39;from the preceding flash. The storm, as is often the case in\n&#39;, &#39;Switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. The\n&#39;, &#39;most violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over the part of the\n&#39;, &#39;lake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of\n&#39;, &#39;Copêt. Another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another\n&#39;, &#39;darkened and sometimes disclosed the Môle, a peaked mountain to the\n&#39;, &#39;east of the lake.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;While I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with\n&#39;, &#39;a hasty step. This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my\n&#39;, &#39;hands, and exclaimed aloud, “William, dear angel! this is thy\n&#39;, &#39;funeral, this thy dirge!” As I said these words, I perceived in the\n&#39;, &#39;gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood\n&#39;, &#39;fixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken. A flash of lightning\n&#39;, &#39;illuminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its\n&#39;, &#39;gigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs\n&#39;, &#39;to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy\n&#39;, &#39;dæmon, to whom I had given life. What did he there? Could he be (I\n&#39;, &#39;shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother? No sooner did that\n&#39;, &#39;idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my teeth\n&#39;, &#39;chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support. The figure\n&#39;, &#39;passed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom. Nothing in human shape could\n&#39;, &#39;have destroyed the fair child. _He_ was the murderer! I could not\n&#39;, &#39;doubt it. The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the\n&#39;, &#39;fact. I thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for\n&#39;, &#39;another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly\n&#39;, &#39;perpendicular ascent of Mont Salêve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the\n&#39;, &#39;south. He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I remained motionless. The thunder ceased; but the rain still\n&#39;, &#39;continued, and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness. I\n&#39;, &#39;revolved in my mind the events which I had until now sought to forget:\n&#39;, &#39;the whole train of my progress toward the creation; the appearance of\n&#39;, &#39;the works of my own hands at my bedside; its departure. Two years had\n&#39;, &#39;now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and\n&#39;, &#39;was this his first crime? Alas! I had turned loose into the world a\n&#39;, &#39;depraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not\n&#39;, &#39;murdered my brother?\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the\n&#39;, &#39;night, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air. But I did not\n&#39;, &#39;feel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in\n&#39;, &#39;scenes of evil and despair. I considered the being whom I had cast\n&#39;, &#39;among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes\n&#39;, &#39;of horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light\n&#39;, &#39;of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced\n&#39;, &#39;to destroy all that was dear to me.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Day dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town. The gates were\n&#39;, &#39;open, and I hastened to my father’s house. My first thought was to\n&#39;, &#39;discover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be\n&#39;, &#39;made. But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell. A\n&#39;, &#39;being whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at\n&#39;, &#39;midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain. I\n&#39;, &#39;remembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at\n&#39;, &#39;the time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of\n&#39;, &#39;delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable. I well knew that\n&#39;, &#39;if any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have\n&#39;, &#39;looked upon it as the ravings of insanity. Besides, the strange nature\n&#39;, &#39;of the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited\n&#39;, &#39;as to persuade my relatives to commence it. And then of what use would\n&#39;, &#39;be pursuit? Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the\n&#39;, &#39;overhanging sides of Mont Salêve? These reflections determined me, and\n&#39;, &#39;I resolved to remain silent.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;It was about five in the morning when I entered my father’s house. I\n&#39;, &#39;told the servants not to disturb the family, and went into the library\n&#39;, &#39;to attend their usual hour of rising.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Six years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and I\n&#39;, &#39;stood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my\n&#39;, &#39;departure for Ingolstadt. Beloved and venerable parent! He still remained\n&#39;, &#39;to me. I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over the\n&#39;, &#39;mantel-piece. It was an historical subject, painted at my father’s\n&#39;, &#39;desire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling\n&#39;, &#39;by the coffin of her dead father. Her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale;\n&#39;, &#39;but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the\n&#39;, &#39;sentiment of pity. Below this picture was a miniature of William; and my\n&#39;, &#39;tears flowed when I looked upon it. While I was thus engaged, Ernest\n&#39;, &#39;entered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me:\n&#39;, &#39;“Welcome, my dearest Victor,” said he. “Ah! I wish you\n&#39;, &#39;had come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and\n&#39;, &#39;delighted. You come to us now to share a misery which nothing can\n&#39;, &#39;alleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive our father, who seems\n&#39;, &#39;sinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poor\n&#39;, &#39;Elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations.—Poor\n&#39;, &#39;William! he was our darling and our pride!”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Tears, unrestrained, fell from my brother’s eyes; a sense of mortal\n&#39;, &#39;agony crept over my frame. Before, I had only imagined the\n&#39;, &#39;wretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and\n&#39;, &#39;a not less terrible, disaster. I tried to calm Ernest; I enquired more\n&#39;, &#39;minutely concerning my father, and here I named my cousin.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“She most of all,” said Ernest, “requires consolation; she accused\n&#39;, &#39;herself of having caused the death of my brother, and that made her\n&#39;, &#39;very wretched. But since the murderer has been discovered—”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“The murderer discovered! Good God! how can that be? who could attempt\n&#39;, &#39;to pursue him? It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the\n&#39;, &#39;winds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw. I saw him too; he\n&#39;, &#39;was free last night!”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I do not know what you mean,” replied my brother, in accents of\n&#39;, &#39;wonder, “but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery. No\n&#39;, &#39;one would believe it at first; and even now Elizabeth will not be\n&#39;, &#39;convinced, notwithstanding all the evidence. Indeed, who would credit\n&#39;, &#39;that Justine Moritz, who was so amiable, and fond of all the family,\n&#39;, &#39;could suddenly become so capable of so frightful, so appalling a crime?”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Justine Moritz! Poor, poor girl, is she the accused? But it is\n&#39;, &#39;wrongfully; every one knows that; no one believes it, surely, Ernest?”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“No one did at first; but several circumstances came out, that have\n&#39;, &#39;almost forced conviction upon us; and her own behaviour has been so\n&#39;, &#39;confused, as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that, I fear,\n&#39;, &#39;leaves no hope for doubt. But she will be tried today, and you will\n&#39;, &#39;then hear all.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;He then related that, the morning on which the murder of poor William\n&#39;, &#39;had been discovered, Justine had been taken ill, and confined to her\n&#39;, &#39;bed for several days. During this interval, one of the servants,\n&#39;, &#39;happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the\n&#39;, &#39;murder, had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother, which\n&#39;, &#39;had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer. The servant\n&#39;, &#39;instantly showed it to one of the others, who, without saying a word to\n&#39;, &#39;any of the family, went to a magistrate; and, upon their deposition,\n&#39;, &#39;Justine was apprehended. On being charged with the fact, the poor girl\n&#39;, &#39;confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of\n&#39;, &#39;manner.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;This was a strange tale, but it did not shake my faith; and I replied\n&#39;, &#39;earnestly, “You are all mistaken; I know the murderer. Justine, poor,\n&#39;, &#39;good Justine, is innocent.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;At that instant my father entered. I saw unhappiness deeply impressed\n&#39;, &#39;on his countenance, but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully; and,\n&#39;, &#39;after we had exchanged our mournful greeting, would have introduced\n&#39;, &#39;some other topic than that of our disaster, had not Ernest exclaimed,\n&#39;, &#39;“Good God, papa! Victor says that he knows who was the murderer of\n&#39;, &#39;poor William.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“We do also, unfortunately,” replied my father, “for indeed I had\n&#39;, &#39;rather have been for ever ignorant than have discovered so much\n&#39;, &#39;depravity and ungratitude in one I valued so highly.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“My dear father, you are mistaken; Justine is innocent.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“If she is, God forbid that she should suffer as guilty. She is to be\n&#39;, &#39;tried today, and I hope, I sincerely hope, that she will be acquitted.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;This speech calmed me. I was firmly convinced in my own mind that\n&#39;, &#39;Justine, and indeed every human being, was guiltless of this murder. I\n&#39;, &#39;had no fear, therefore, that any circumstantial evidence could be\n&#39;, &#39;brought forward strong enough to convict her. My tale was not one to\n&#39;, &#39;announce publicly; its astounding horror would be looked upon as\n&#39;, &#39;madness by the vulgar. Did any one indeed exist, except I, the\n&#39;, &#39;creator, who would believe, unless his senses convinced him, in the\n&#39;, &#39;existence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance\n&#39;, &#39;which I had let loose upon the world?\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;We were soon joined by Elizabeth. Time had altered her since I last\n&#39;, &#39;beheld her; it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of\n&#39;, &#39;her childish years. There was the same candour, the same vivacity, but\n&#39;, &#39;it was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect.\n&#39;, &#39;She welcomed me with the greatest affection. “Your arrival, my dear\n&#39;, &#39;cousin,” said she, “fills me with hope. You perhaps will find some\n&#39;, &#39;means to justify my poor guiltless Justine. Alas! who is safe, if she\n&#39;, &#39;be convicted of crime? I rely on her innocence as certainly as I do\n&#39;, &#39;upon my own. Our misfortune is doubly hard to us; we have not only\n&#39;, &#39;lost that lovely darling boy, but this poor girl, whom I sincerely\n&#39;, &#39;love, is to be torn away by even a worse fate. If she is condemned, I\n&#39;, &#39;never shall know joy more. But she will not, I am sure she will not;\n&#39;, &#39;and then I shall be happy again, even after the sad death of my little\n&#39;, &#39;William.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“She is innocent, my Elizabeth,” said I, “and that shall\n&#39;, &#39;be proved; fear nothing, but let your spirits be cheered by the assurance\n&#39;, &#39;of her acquittal.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“How kind and generous you are! every one else believes in her guilt,\n&#39;, &#39;and that made me wretched, for I knew that it was impossible: and to\n&#39;, &#39;see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me\n&#39;, &#39;hopeless and despairing.” She wept.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Dearest niece,” said my father, “dry your tears. If she\n&#39;, &#39;is, as you believe, innocent, rely on the justice of our laws, and the\n&#39;, &#39;activity with which I shall prevent the slightest shadow of\n&#39;, &#39;partiality.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Chapter 8\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;We passed a few sad hours until eleven o’clock, when the trial was to\n&#39;, &#39;commence. My father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend\n&#39;, &#39;as witnesses, I accompanied them to the court. During the whole of\n&#39;, &#39;this wretched mockery of justice I suffered living torture. It was to\n&#39;, &#39;be decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would\n&#39;, &#39;cause the death of two of my fellow beings: one a smiling babe full of\n&#39;, &#39;innocence and joy, the other far more dreadfully murdered, with every\n&#39;, &#39;aggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror.\n&#39;, &#39;Justine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised\n&#39;, &#39;to render her life happy; now all was to be obliterated in an\n&#39;, &#39;ignominious grave, and I the cause! A thousand times rather would I\n&#39;, &#39;have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to Justine, but I\n&#39;, &#39;was absent when it was committed, and such a declaration would have\n&#39;, &#39;been considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have\n&#39;, &#39;exculpated her who suffered through me.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;The appearance of Justine was calm. She was dressed in mourning, and\n&#39;, &#39;her countenance, always engaging, was rendered, by the solemnity of her\n&#39;, &#39;feelings, exquisitely beautiful. Yet she appeared confident in\n&#39;, &#39;innocence and did not tremble, although gazed on and execrated by\n&#39;, &#39;thousands, for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have\n&#39;, &#39;excited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the\n&#39;, &#39;imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed. She\n&#39;, &#39;was tranquil, yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained; and as\n&#39;, &#39;her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt, she\n&#39;, &#39;worked up her mind to an appearance of courage. When she entered the\n&#39;, &#39;court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were\n&#39;, &#39;seated. A tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us, but she quickly\n&#39;, &#39;recovered herself, and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest\n&#39;, &#39;her utter guiltlessness.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;The trial began, and after the advocate against her had stated the\n&#39;, &#39;charge, several witnesses were called. Several strange facts combined\n&#39;, &#39;against her, which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof\n&#39;, &#39;of her innocence as I had. She had been out the whole of the night on\n&#39;, &#39;which the murder had been committed and towards morning had been\n&#39;, &#39;perceived by a market-woman not far from the spot where the body of the\n&#39;, &#39;murdered child had been afterwards found. The woman asked her what she\n&#39;, &#39;did there, but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused\n&#39;, &#39;and unintelligible answer. She returned to the house about eight\n&#39;, &#39;o’clock, and when one inquired where she had passed the night, she\n&#39;, &#39;replied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly\n&#39;, &#39;if anything had been heard concerning him. When shown the body, she\n&#39;, &#39;fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days. The\n&#39;, &#39;picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket;\n&#39;, &#39;and when Elizabeth, in a faltering voice, proved that it was the same\n&#39;, &#39;which, an hour before the child had been missed, she had placed round\n&#39;, &#39;his neck, a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Justine was called on for her defence. As the trial had proceeded, her\n&#39;, &#39;countenance had altered. Surprise, horror, and misery were strongly\n&#39;, &#39;expressed. Sometimes she struggled with her tears, but when she was\n&#39;, &#39;desired to plead, she collected her powers and spoke in an audible\n&#39;, &#39;although variable voice.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“God knows,” she said, “how entirely I am innocent. But I\n&#39;, &#39;do not pretend that my protestations should acquit me; I rest my innocence\n&#39;, &#39;on a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced\n&#39;, &#39;against me, and I hope the character I have always borne will incline my\n&#39;, &#39;judges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears\n&#39;, &#39;doubtful or suspicious.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;She then related that, by the permission of Elizabeth, she had passed\n&#39;, &#39;the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the\n&#39;, &#39;house of an aunt at Chêne, a village situated at about a league from\n&#39;, &#39;Geneva. On her return, at about nine o’clock, she met a man who asked\n&#39;, &#39;her if she had seen anything of the child who was lost. She was\n&#39;, &#39;alarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him,\n&#39;, &#39;when the gates of Geneva were shut, and she was forced to remain\n&#39;, &#39;several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage, being\n&#39;, &#39;unwilling to call up the inhabitants, to whom she was well known. Most\n&#39;, &#39;of the night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed that\n&#39;, &#39;she slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her, and she awoke.\n&#39;, &#39;It was dawn, and she quitted her asylum, that she might again endeavour\n&#39;, &#39;to find my brother. If she had gone near the spot where his body lay,\n&#39;, &#39;it was without her knowledge. That she had been bewildered when\n&#39;, &#39;questioned by the market-woman was not surprising, since she had passed\n&#39;, &#39;a sleepless night and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain.\n&#39;, &#39;Concerning the picture she could give no account.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I know,” continued the unhappy victim, “how heavily and\n&#39;, &#39;fatally this one circumstance weighs against me, but I have no power of\n&#39;, &#39;explaining it; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance, I am only left\n&#39;, &#39;to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been\n&#39;, &#39;placed in my pocket. But here also I am checked. I believe that I have no\n&#39;, &#39;enemy on earth, and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me\n&#39;, &#39;wantonly. Did the murderer place it there? I know of no opportunity\n&#39;, &#39;afforded him for so doing; or, if I had, why should he have stolen the\n&#39;, &#39;jewel, to part with it again so soon?\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I commit my cause to the justice of my judges, yet I see no room for\n&#39;, &#39;hope. I beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my\n&#39;, &#39;character, and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed\n&#39;, &#39;guilt, I must be condemned, although I would pledge my salvation on my\n&#39;, &#39;innocence.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Several witnesses were called who had known her for many years, and\n&#39;, &#39;they spoke well of her; but fear and hatred of the crime of which they\n&#39;, &#39;supposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come\n&#39;, &#39;forward. Elizabeth saw even this last resource, her excellent\n&#39;, &#39;dispositions and irreproachable conduct, about to fail the accused,\n&#39;, &#39;when, although violently agitated, she desired permission to address\n&#39;, &#39;the court.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I am,” said she, “the cousin of the unhappy child who\n&#39;, &#39;was murdered, or rather his sister, for I was educated by and have lived\n&#39;, &#39;with his parents ever since and even long before his birth. It may\n&#39;, &#39;therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion, but\n&#39;, &#39;when I see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her\n&#39;, &#39;pretended friends, I wish to be allowed to speak, that I may say what I\n&#39;, &#39;know of her character. I am well acquainted with the accused. I have lived\n&#39;, &#39;in the same house with her, at one time for five and at another for nearly\n&#39;, &#39;two years. During all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and\n&#39;, &#39;benevolent of human creatures. She nursed Madame Frankenstein, my aunt, in\n&#39;, &#39;her last illness, with the greatest affection and care and afterwards\n&#39;, &#39;attended her own mother during a tedious illness, in a manner that excited\n&#39;, &#39;the admiration of all who knew her, after which she again lived in my\n&#39;, &#39;uncle’s house, where she was beloved by all the family. She was\n&#39;, &#39;warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a\n&#39;, &#39;most affectionate mother. For my own part, I do not hesitate to say that,\n&#39;, &#39;notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her, I believe and rely\n&#39;, &#39;on her perfect innocence. She had no temptation for such an action; as to\n&#39;, &#39;the bauble on which the chief proof rests, if she had earnestly desired it,\n&#39;, &#39;I should have willingly given it to her, so much do I esteem and value\n&#39;, &#39;her.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;A murmur of approbation followed Elizabeth’s simple and powerful\n&#39;, &#39;appeal, but it was excited by her generous interference, and not in\n&#39;, &#39;favour of poor Justine, on whom the public indignation was turned with\n&#39;, &#39;renewed violence, charging her with the blackest ingratitude. She\n&#39;, &#39;herself wept as Elizabeth spoke, but she did not answer. My own\n&#39;, &#39;agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial. I believed\n&#39;, &#39;in her innocence; I knew it. Could the dæmon who had (I did not for a\n&#39;, &#39;minute doubt) murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have\n&#39;, &#39;betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy? I could not sustain the\n&#39;, &#39;horror of my situation, and when I perceived that the popular voice and\n&#39;, &#39;the countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim,\n&#39;, &#39;I rushed out of the court in agony. The tortures of the accused did\n&#39;, &#39;not equal mine; she was sustained by innocence, but the fangs of\n&#39;, &#39;remorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I passed a night of unmingled wretchedness. In the morning I went to\n&#39;, &#39;the court; my lips and throat were parched. I dared not ask the fatal\n&#39;, &#39;question, but I was known, and the officer guessed the cause of my\n&#39;, &#39;visit. The ballots had been thrown; they were all black, and Justine\n&#39;, &#39;was condemned.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I cannot pretend to describe what I then felt. I had before\n&#39;, &#39;experienced sensations of horror, and I have endeavoured to bestow upon\n&#39;, &#39;them adequate expressions, but words cannot convey an idea of the\n&#39;, &#39;heart-sickening despair that I then endured. The person to whom I\n&#39;, &#39;addressed myself added that Justine had already confessed her guilt.\n&#39;, &#39;“That evidence,” he observed, “was hardly required in so glaring a\n&#39;, &#39;case, but I am glad of it, and, indeed, none of our judges like to\n&#39;, &#39;condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence, be it ever so\n&#39;, &#39;decisive.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;This was strange and unexpected intelligence; what could it mean? Had\n&#39;, &#39;my eyes deceived me? And was I really as mad as the whole world would\n&#39;, &#39;believe me to be if I disclosed the object of my suspicions? I\n&#39;, &#39;hastened to return home, and Elizabeth eagerly demanded the result.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“My cousin,” replied I, “it is decided as you may have expected; all\n&#39;, &#39;judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty\n&#39;, &#39;should escape. But she has confessed.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;This was a dire blow to poor Elizabeth, who had relied with firmness upon\n&#39;, &#39;Justine’s innocence. “Alas!” said she. “How shall I\n&#39;, &#39;ever again believe in human goodness? Justine, whom I loved and esteemed as\n&#39;, &#39;my sister, how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray?\n&#39;, &#39;Her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile, and yet she has\n&#39;, &#39;committed a murder.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my\n&#39;, &#39;cousin. My father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her own\n&#39;, &#39;judgment and feelings to decide. “Yes,” said Elizabeth,\n&#39;, &#39;“I will go, although she is guilty; and you, Victor, shall accompany\n&#39;, &#39;me; I cannot go alone.” The idea of this visit was torture to me, yet\n&#39;, &#39;I could not refuse.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;We entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld Justine sitting on some\n&#39;, &#39;straw at the farther end; her hands were manacled, and her head rested on\n&#39;, &#39;her knees. She rose on seeing us enter, and when we were left alone with\n&#39;, &#39;her, she threw herself at the feet of Elizabeth, weeping bitterly. My\n&#39;, &#39;cousin wept also.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Oh, Justine!” said she. “Why did you rob me of my last consolation?\n&#39;, &#39;I relied on your innocence, and although I was then very wretched, I\n&#39;, &#39;was not so miserable as I am now.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“And do you also believe that I am so very, very wicked? Do you also\n&#39;, &#39;join with my enemies to crush me, to condemn me as a murderer?” Her\n&#39;, &#39;voice was suffocated with sobs.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Rise, my poor girl,” said Elizabeth; “why do you kneel,\n&#39;, &#39;if you are innocent? I am not one of your enemies, I believed you\n&#39;, &#39;guiltless, notwithstanding every evidence, until I heard that you had\n&#39;, &#39;yourself declared your guilt. That report, you say, is false; and be\n&#39;, &#39;assured, dear Justine, that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a\n&#39;, &#39;moment, but your own confession.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I did confess, but I confessed a lie. I confessed, that I might\n&#39;, &#39;obtain absolution; but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than\n&#39;, &#39;all my other sins. The God of heaven forgive me! Ever since I was\n&#39;, &#39;condemned, my confessor has besieged me; he threatened and menaced,\n&#39;, &#39;until I almost began to think that I was the monster that he said I\n&#39;, &#39;was. He threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last moments if\n&#39;, &#39;I continued obdurate. Dear lady, I had none to support me; all looked\n&#39;, &#39;on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition. What could I do?\n&#39;, &#39;In an evil hour I subscribed to a lie; and now only am I truly\n&#39;, &#39;miserable.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;She paused, weeping, and then continued, “I thought with horror, my\n&#39;, &#39;sweet lady, that you should believe your Justine, whom your blessed\n&#39;, &#39;aunt had so highly honoured, and whom you loved, was a creature capable\n&#39;, &#39;of a crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated.\n&#39;, &#39;Dear William! dearest blessed child! I soon shall see you again in\n&#39;, &#39;heaven, where we shall all be happy; and that consoles me, going as I\n&#39;, &#39;am to suffer ignominy and death.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Oh, Justine! Forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you.\n&#39;, &#39;Why did you confess? But do not mourn, dear girl. Do not fear. I\n&#39;, &#39;will proclaim, I will prove your innocence. I will melt the stony\n&#39;, &#39;hearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers. You shall not die!\n&#39;, &#39;You, my playfellow, my companion, my sister, perish on the scaffold!\n&#39;, &#39;No! No! I never could survive so horrible a misfortune.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Justine shook her head mournfully. “I do not fear to die,” she said;\n&#39;, &#39;“that pang is past. God raises my weakness and gives me courage to\n&#39;, &#39;endure the worst. I leave a sad and bitter world; and if you remember\n&#39;, &#39;me and think of me as of one unjustly condemned, I am resigned to the\n&#39;, &#39;fate awaiting me. Learn from me, dear lady, to submit in patience to\n&#39;, &#39;the will of heaven!”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;During this conversation I had retired to a corner of the prison room,\n&#39;, &#39;where I could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me. Despair!\n&#39;, &#39;Who dared talk of that? The poor victim, who on the morrow was to pass\n&#39;, &#39;the awful boundary between life and death, felt not, as I did, such\n&#39;, &#39;deep and bitter agony. I gnashed my teeth and ground them together,\n&#39;, &#39;uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul. Justine started. When\n&#39;, &#39;she saw who it was, she approached me and said, “Dear sir, you are very\n&#39;, &#39;kind to visit me; you, I hope, do not believe that I am guilty?”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I could not answer. “No, Justine,” said Elizabeth; “he is more\n&#39;, &#39;convinced of your innocence than I was, for even when he heard that you\n&#39;, &#39;had confessed, he did not credit it.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I truly thank him. In these last moments I feel the sincerest\n&#39;, &#39;gratitude towards those who think of me with kindness. How sweet is\n&#39;, &#39;the affection of others to such a wretch as I am! It removes more than\n&#39;, &#39;half my misfortune, and I feel as if I could die in peace now that my\n&#39;, &#39;innocence is acknowledged by you, dear lady, and your cousin.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself. She indeed\n&#39;, &#39;gained the resignation she desired. But I, the true murderer, felt the\n&#39;, &#39;never-dying worm alive in my bosom, which allowed of no hope or\n&#39;, &#39;consolation. Elizabeth also wept and was unhappy, but hers also was\n&#39;, &#39;the misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair\n&#39;, &#39;moon, for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness. Anguish and\n&#39;, &#39;despair had penetrated into the core of my heart; I bore a hell within\n&#39;, &#39;me which nothing could extinguish. We stayed several hours with\n&#39;, &#39;Justine, and it was with great difficulty that Elizabeth could tear\n&#39;, &#39;herself away. “I wish,” cried she, “that I were to die with you; I\n&#39;, &#39;cannot live in this world of misery.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Justine assumed an air of cheerfulness, while she with difficulty\n&#39;, &#39;repressed her bitter tears. She embraced Elizabeth and said in a voice\n&#39;, &#39;of half-suppressed emotion, “Farewell, sweet lady, dearest Elizabeth,\n&#39;, &#39;my beloved and only friend; may heaven, in its bounty, bless and\n&#39;, &#39;preserve you; may this be the last misfortune that you will ever\n&#39;, &#39;suffer! Live, and be happy, and make others so.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;And on the morrow Justine died. Elizabeth’s heart-rending eloquence\n&#39;, &#39;failed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the\n&#39;, &#39;criminality of the saintly sufferer. My passionate and indignant\n&#39;, &#39;appeals were lost upon them. And when I received their cold answers\n&#39;, &#39;and heard the harsh, unfeeling reasoning of these men, my purposed\n&#39;, &#39;avowal died away on my lips. Thus I might proclaim myself a madman,\n&#39;, &#39;but not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim. She\n&#39;, &#39;perished on the scaffold as a murderess!\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;From the tortures of my own heart, I turned to contemplate the deep and\n&#39;, &#39;voiceless grief of my Elizabeth. This also was my doing! And my\n&#39;, &#39;father’s woe, and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was\n&#39;, &#39;the work of my thrice-accursed hands! Ye weep, unhappy ones, but these\n&#39;, &#39;are not your last tears! Again shall you raise the funeral wail, and\n&#39;, &#39;the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard!\n&#39;, &#39;Frankenstein, your son, your kinsman, your early, much-loved friend; he\n&#39;, &#39;who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes, who has no\n&#39;, &#39;thought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear\n&#39;, &#39;countenances, who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life\n&#39;, &#39;in serving you—he bids you weep, to shed countless tears; happy beyond\n&#39;, &#39;his hopes, if thus inexorable fate be satisfied, and if the destruction\n&#39;, &#39;pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments!\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Thus spoke my prophetic soul, as, torn by remorse, horror, and despair,\n&#39;, &#39;I beheld those I loved spend vain sorrow upon the graves of William and\n&#39;, &#39;Justine, the first hapless victims to my unhallowed arts.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Chapter 9\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Nothing is more painful to the human mind than, after the feelings have\n&#39;, &#39;been worked up by a quick succession of events, the dead calmness of\n&#39;, &#39;inaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope\n&#39;, &#39;and fear. Justine died, she rested, and I was alive. The blood flowed\n&#39;, &#39;freely in my veins, but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my\n&#39;, &#39;heart which nothing could remove. Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered\n&#39;, &#39;like an evil spirit, for I had committed deeds of mischief beyond\n&#39;, &#39;description horrible, and more, much more (I persuaded myself) was yet\n&#39;, &#39;behind. Yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue.\n&#39;, &#39;I had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment\n&#39;, &#39;when I should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow\n&#39;, &#39;beings. Now all was blasted; instead of that serenity of conscience\n&#39;, &#39;which allowed me to look back upon the past with self-satisfaction, and\n&#39;, &#39;from thence to gather promise of new hopes, I was seized by remorse and\n&#39;, &#39;the sense of guilt, which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures\n&#39;, &#39;such as no language can describe.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;This state of mind preyed upon my health, which had perhaps never\n&#39;, &#39;entirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained. I shunned\n&#39;, &#39;the face of man; all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me;\n&#39;, &#39;solitude was my only consolation—deep, dark, deathlike solitude.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;My father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition\n&#39;, &#39;and habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of his\n&#39;, &#39;serene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and\n&#39;, &#39;awaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me.\n&#39;, &#39;“Do you think, Victor,” said he, “that I do not suffer\n&#39;, &#39;also? No one could love a child more than I loved your\n&#39;, &#39;brother”—tears came into his eyes as he spoke—“but\n&#39;, &#39;is it not a duty to the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting\n&#39;, &#39;their unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief? It is also a duty\n&#39;, &#39;owed to yourself, for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment,\n&#39;, &#39;or even the discharge of daily usefulness, without which no man is fit for\n&#39;, &#39;society.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;This advice, although good, was totally inapplicable to my case; I\n&#39;, &#39;should have been the first to hide my grief and console my friends if\n&#39;, &#39;remorse had not mingled its bitterness, and terror its alarm, with my\n&#39;, &#39;other sensations. Now I could only answer my father with a look of\n&#39;, &#39;despair and endeavour to hide myself from his view.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;About this time we retired to our house at Belrive. This change was\n&#39;, &#39;particularly agreeable to me. The shutting of the gates regularly at\n&#39;, &#39;ten o’clock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that\n&#39;, &#39;hour had rendered our residence within the walls of Geneva very irksome\n&#39;, &#39;to me. I was now free. Often, after the rest of the family had\n&#39;, &#39;retired for the night, I took the boat and passed many hours upon the\n&#39;, &#39;water. Sometimes, with my sails set, I was carried by the wind; and\n&#39;, &#39;sometimes, after rowing into the middle of the lake, I left the boat to\n&#39;, &#39;pursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections. I\n&#39;, &#39;was often tempted, when all was at peace around me, and I the only\n&#39;, &#39;unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and\n&#39;, &#39;heavenly—if I except some bat, or the frogs, whose harsh and\n&#39;, &#39;interrupted croaking was heard only when I approached the shore—often,\n&#39;, &#39;I say, I was tempted to plunge into the silent lake, that the waters\n&#39;, &#39;might close over me and my calamities for ever. But I was restrained,\n&#39;, &#39;when I thought of the heroic and suffering Elizabeth, whom I tenderly\n&#39;, &#39;loved, and whose existence was bound up in mine. I thought also of my\n&#39;, &#39;father and surviving brother; should I by my base desertion leave them\n&#39;, &#39;exposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom I had let loose\n&#39;, &#39;among them?\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;At these moments I wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my\n&#39;, &#39;mind only that I might afford them consolation and happiness. But that\n&#39;, &#39;could not be. Remorse extinguished every hope. I had been the author of\n&#39;, &#39;unalterable evils, and I lived in daily fear lest the monster whom I had\n&#39;, &#39;created should perpetrate some new wickedness. I had an obscure feeling\n&#39;, &#39;that all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime,\n&#39;, &#39;which by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past.\n&#39;, &#39;There was always scope for fear so long as anything I loved remained\n&#39;, &#39;behind. My abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived. When I thought of\n&#39;, &#39;him I gnashed my teeth, my eyes became inflamed, and I ardently wished to\n&#39;, &#39;extinguish that life which I had so thoughtlessly bestowed. When I\n&#39;, &#39;reflected on his crimes and malice, my hatred and revenge burst all bounds\n&#39;, &#39;of moderation. I would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the\n&#39;, &#39;Andes, could I, when there, have precipitated him to their base. I wished\n&#39;, &#39;to see him again, that I might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his\n&#39;, &#39;head and avenge the deaths of William and Justine.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Our house was the house of mourning. My father’s health was deeply\n&#39;, &#39;shaken by the horror of the recent events. Elizabeth was sad and\n&#39;, &#39;desponding; she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations; all\n&#39;, &#39;pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead; eternal woe and tears she\n&#39;, &#39;then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted\n&#39;, &#39;and destroyed. She was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth\n&#39;, &#39;wandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our\n&#39;, &#39;future prospects. The first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from\n&#39;, &#39;the earth had visited her, and its dimming influence quenched her dearest\n&#39;, &#39;smiles.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“When I reflect, my dear cousin,” said she, “on the miserable death of\n&#39;, &#39;Justine Moritz, I no longer see the world and its works as they before\n&#39;, &#39;appeared to me. Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and\n&#39;, &#39;injustice that I read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient\n&#39;, &#39;days or imaginary evils; at least they were remote and more familiar to\n&#39;, &#39;reason than to the imagination; but now misery has come home, and men\n&#39;, &#39;appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other’s blood. Yet I am\n&#39;, &#39;certainly unjust. Everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty; and\n&#39;, &#39;if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered, assuredly\n&#39;, &#39;she would have been the most depraved of human creatures. For the sake\n&#39;, &#39;of a few jewels, to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend,\n&#39;, &#39;a child whom she had nursed from its birth, and appeared to love as if\n&#39;, &#39;it had been her own! I could not consent to the death of any human\n&#39;, &#39;being, but certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to\n&#39;, &#39;remain in the society of men. But she was innocent. I know, I feel\n&#39;, &#39;she was innocent; you are of the same opinion, and that confirms me.\n&#39;, &#39;Alas! Victor, when falsehood can look so like the truth, who can\n&#39;, &#39;assure themselves of certain happiness? I feel as if I were walking on\n&#39;, &#39;the edge of a precipice, towards which thousands are crowding and\n&#39;, &#39;endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss. William and Justine were\n&#39;, &#39;assassinated, and the murderer escapes; he walks about the world free,\n&#39;, &#39;and perhaps respected. But even if I were condemned to suffer on the\n&#39;, &#39;scaffold for the same crimes, I would not change places with such a\n&#39;, &#39;wretch.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I listened to this discourse with the extremest agony. I, not in deed,\n&#39;, &#39;but in effect, was the true murderer. Elizabeth read my anguish in my\n&#39;, &#39;countenance, and kindly taking my hand, said, “My dearest friend, you\n&#39;, &#39;must calm yourself. These events have affected me, God knows how\n&#39;, &#39;deeply; but I am not so wretched as you are. There is an expression of\n&#39;, &#39;despair, and sometimes of revenge, in your countenance that makes me\n&#39;, &#39;tremble. Dear Victor, banish these dark passions. Remember the\n&#39;, &#39;friends around you, who centre all their hopes in you. Have we lost\n&#39;, &#39;the power of rendering you happy? Ah! While we love, while we are\n&#39;, &#39;true to each other, here in this land of peace and beauty, your native\n&#39;, &#39;country, we may reap every tranquil blessing—what can disturb our\n&#39;, &#39;peace?”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;And could not such words from her whom I fondly prized before every\n&#39;, &#39;other gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my\n&#39;, &#39;heart? Even as she spoke I drew near to her, as if in terror, lest at\n&#39;, &#39;that very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Thus not the tenderness of friendship, nor the beauty of earth, nor of\n&#39;, &#39;heaven, could redeem my soul from woe; the very accents of love were\n&#39;, &#39;ineffectual. I was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial\n&#39;, &#39;influence could penetrate. The wounded deer dragging its fainting\n&#39;, &#39;limbs to some untrodden brake, there to gaze upon the arrow which had\n&#39;, &#39;pierced it, and to die, was but a type of me.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Sometimes I could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me, but\n&#39;, &#39;sometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek, by bodily\n&#39;, &#39;exercise and by change of place, some relief from my intolerable\n&#39;, &#39;sensations. It was during an access of this kind that I suddenly left\n&#39;, &#39;my home, and bending my steps towards the near Alpine valleys, sought\n&#39;, &#39;in the magnificence, the eternity of such scenes, to forget myself and\n&#39;, &#39;my ephemeral, because human, sorrows. My wanderings were directed\n&#39;, &#39;towards the valley of Chamounix. I had visited it frequently during my\n&#39;, &#39;boyhood. Six years had passed since then: _I_ was a wreck, but nought\n&#39;, &#39;had changed in those savage and enduring scenes.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I performed the first part of my journey on horseback. I afterwards\n&#39;, &#39;hired a mule, as the more sure-footed and least liable to receive\n&#39;, &#39;injury on these rugged roads. The weather was fine; it was about the\n&#39;, &#39;middle of the month of August, nearly two months after the death of\n&#39;, &#39;Justine, that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe. The\n&#39;, &#39;weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper in\n&#39;, &#39;the ravine of Arve. The immense mountains and precipices that overhung\n&#39;, &#39;me on every side, the sound of the river raging among the rocks, and\n&#39;, &#39;the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as\n&#39;, &#39;Omnipotence—and I ceased to fear or to bend before any being less\n&#39;, &#39;almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements, here\n&#39;, &#39;displayed in their most terrific guise. Still, as I ascended higher,\n&#39;, &#39;the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character.\n&#39;, &#39;Ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains, the\n&#39;, &#39;impetuous Arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth from\n&#39;, &#39;among the trees formed a scene of singular beauty. But it was\n&#39;, &#39;augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty Alps, whose white and\n&#39;, &#39;shining pyramids and domes towered above all, as belonging to another\n&#39;, &#39;earth, the habitations of another race of beings.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I passed the bridge of Pélissier, where the ravine, which the river\n&#39;, &#39;forms, opened before me, and I began to ascend the mountain that\n&#39;, &#39;overhangs it. Soon after, I entered the valley of Chamounix. This\n&#39;, &#39;valley is more wonderful and sublime, but not so beautiful and\n&#39;, &#39;picturesque as that of Servox, through which I had just passed. The\n&#39;, &#39;high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries, but I saw no\n&#39;, &#39;more ruined castles and fertile fields. Immense glaciers approached\n&#39;, &#39;the road; I heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and\n&#39;, &#39;marked the smoke of its passage. Mont Blanc, the supreme and\n&#39;, &#39;magnificent Mont Blanc, raised itself from the surrounding _aiguilles_,\n&#39;, &#39;and its tremendous _dôme_ overlooked the valley.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;A tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this\n&#39;, &#39;journey. Some turn in the road, some new object suddenly perceived and\n&#39;, &#39;recognised, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the\n&#39;, &#39;lighthearted gaiety of boyhood. The very winds whispered in soothing\n&#39;, &#39;accents, and maternal Nature bade me weep no more. Then again the\n&#39;, &#39;kindly influence ceased to act—I found myself fettered again to grief\n&#39;, &#39;and indulging in all the misery of reflection. Then I spurred on my\n&#39;, &#39;animal, striving so to forget the world, my fears, and more than all,\n&#39;, &#39;myself—or, in a more desperate fashion, I alighted and threw myself on\n&#39;, &#39;the grass, weighed down by horror and despair.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;At length I arrived at the village of Chamounix. Exhaustion succeeded\n&#39;, &#39;to the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which I had endured.\n&#39;, &#39;For a short space of time I remained at the window watching the pallid\n&#39;, &#39;lightnings that played above Mont Blanc and listening to the rushing of\n&#39;, &#39;the Arve, which pursued its noisy way beneath. The same lulling sounds\n&#39;, &#39;acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations; when I placed my head\n&#39;, &#39;upon my pillow, sleep crept over me; I felt it as it came and blessed\n&#39;, &#39;the giver of oblivion.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Chapter 10\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I spent the following day roaming through the valley. I stood beside\n&#39;, &#39;the sources of the Arveiron, which take their rise in a glacier, that\n&#39;, &#39;with slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to\n&#39;, &#39;barricade the valley. The abrupt sides of vast mountains were before\n&#39;, &#39;me; the icy wall of the glacier overhung me; a few shattered pines were\n&#39;, &#39;scattered around; and the solemn silence of this glorious\n&#39;, &#39;presence-chamber of imperial Nature was broken only by the brawling\n&#39;, &#39;waves or the fall of some vast fragment, the thunder sound of the\n&#39;, &#39;avalanche or the cracking, reverberated along the mountains, of the\n&#39;, &#39;accumulated ice, which, through the silent working of immutable laws,\n&#39;, &#39;was ever and anon rent and torn, as if it had been but a plaything in\n&#39;, &#39;their hands. These sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the\n&#39;, &#39;greatest consolation that I was capable of receiving. They elevated me\n&#39;, &#39;from all littleness of feeling, and although they did not remove my\n&#39;, &#39;grief, they subdued and tranquillised it. In some degree, also, they\n&#39;, &#39;diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the\n&#39;, &#39;last month. I retired to rest at night; my slumbers, as it were,\n&#39;, &#39;waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which I\n&#39;, &#39;had contemplated during the day. They congregated round me; the\n&#39;, &#39;unstained snowy mountain-top, the glittering pinnacle, the pine woods,\n&#39;, &#39;and ragged bare ravine, the eagle, soaring amidst the clouds—they all\n&#39;, &#39;gathered round me and bade me be at peace.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Where had they fled when the next morning I awoke? All of\n&#39;, &#39;soul-inspiriting fled with sleep, and dark melancholy clouded every\n&#39;, &#39;thought. The rain was pouring in torrents, and thick mists hid the\n&#39;, &#39;summits of the mountains, so that I even saw not the faces of those\n&#39;, &#39;mighty friends. Still I would penetrate their misty veil and seek them\n&#39;, &#39;in their cloudy retreats. What were rain and storm to me? My mule was\n&#39;, &#39;brought to the door, and I resolved to ascend to the summit of\n&#39;, &#39;Montanvert. I remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous\n&#39;, &#39;and ever-moving glacier had produced upon my mind when I first saw it.\n&#39;, &#39;It had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the\n&#39;, &#39;soul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy.\n&#39;, &#39;The sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the\n&#39;, &#39;effect of solemnising my mind and causing me to forget the passing\n&#39;, &#39;cares of life. I determined to go without a guide, for I was well\n&#39;, &#39;acquainted with the path, and the presence of another would destroy the\n&#39;, &#39;solitary grandeur of the scene.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;The ascent is precipitous, but the path is cut into continual and short\n&#39;, &#39;windings, which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the\n&#39;, &#39;mountain. It is a scene terrifically desolate. In a thousand spots\n&#39;, &#39;the traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived, where trees lie\n&#39;, &#39;broken and strewed on the ground, some entirely destroyed, others bent,\n&#39;, &#39;leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon\n&#39;, &#39;other trees. The path, as you ascend higher, is intersected by ravines\n&#39;, &#39;of snow, down which stones continually roll from above; one of them is\n&#39;, &#39;particularly dangerous, as the slightest sound, such as even speaking\n&#39;, &#39;in a loud voice, produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw\n&#39;, &#39;destruction upon the head of the speaker. The pines are not tall or\n&#39;, &#39;luxuriant, but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene.\n&#39;, &#39;I looked on the valley beneath; vast mists were rising from the rivers\n&#39;, &#39;which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite\n&#39;, &#39;mountains, whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds, while rain\n&#39;, &#39;poured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression I\n&#39;, &#39;received from the objects around me. Alas! Why does man boast of\n&#39;, &#39;sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute; it only renders\n&#39;, &#39;them more necessary beings. If our impulses were confined to hunger,\n&#39;, &#39;thirst, and desire, we might be nearly free; but now we are moved by\n&#39;, &#39;every wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may\n&#39;, &#39;convey to us.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;  We rest; a dream has power to poison sleep.\n&#39;, &#39;     We rise; one wand’ring thought pollutes the day.\n&#39;, &#39;  We feel, conceive, or reason; laugh or weep,\n&#39;, &#39;     Embrace fond woe, or cast our cares away;\n&#39;, &#39;  It is the same: for, be it joy or sorrow,\n&#39;, &#39;     The path of its departure still is free.\n&#39;, &#39;  Man’s yesterday may ne’er be like his morrow;\n&#39;, &#39;     Nought may endure but mutability!\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;It was nearly noon when I arrived at the top of the ascent. For some\n&#39;, &#39;time I sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice. A mist covered\n&#39;, &#39;both that and the surrounding mountains. Presently a breeze dissipated\n&#39;, &#39;the cloud, and I descended upon the glacier. The surface is very\n&#39;, &#39;uneven, rising like the waves of a troubled sea, descending low, and\n&#39;, &#39;interspersed by rifts that sink deep. The field of ice is almost a\n&#39;, &#39;league in width, but I spent nearly two hours in crossing it. The\n&#39;, &#39;opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock. From the side where I\n&#39;, &#39;now stood Montanvert was exactly opposite, at the distance of a league;\n&#39;, &#39;and above it rose Mont Blanc, in awful majesty. I remained in a recess\n&#39;, &#39;of the rock, gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene. The sea,\n&#39;, &#39;or rather the vast river of ice, wound among its dependent mountains,\n&#39;, &#39;whose aerial summits hung over its recesses. Their icy and glittering\n&#39;, &#39;peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds. My heart, which was\n&#39;, &#39;before sorrowful, now swelled with something like joy; I exclaimed,\n&#39;, &#39;“Wandering spirits, if indeed ye wander, and do not rest in your narrow\n&#39;, &#39;beds, allow me this faint happiness, or take me, as your companion,\n&#39;, &#39;away from the joys of life.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;As I said this I suddenly beheld the figure of a man, at some distance,\n&#39;, &#39;advancing towards me with superhuman speed. He bounded over the\n&#39;, &#39;crevices in the ice, among which I had walked with caution; his\n&#39;, &#39;stature, also, as he approached, seemed to exceed that of man. I was\n&#39;, &#39;troubled; a mist came over my eyes, and I felt a faintness seize me,\n&#39;, &#39;but I was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains. I\n&#39;, &#39;perceived, as the shape came nearer (sight tremendous and abhorred!)\n&#39;, &#39;that it was the wretch whom I had created. I trembled with rage and\n&#39;, &#39;horror, resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in\n&#39;, &#39;mortal combat. He approached; his countenance bespoke bitter anguish,\n&#39;, &#39;combined with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness\n&#39;, &#39;rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes. But I scarcely\n&#39;, &#39;observed this; rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance,\n&#39;, &#39;and I recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious\n&#39;, &#39;detestation and contempt.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Devil,” I exclaimed, “do you dare approach me? And do\n&#39;, &#39;not you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head?\n&#39;, &#39;Begone, vile insect! Or rather, stay, that I may trample you to dust! And,\n&#39;, &#39;oh! That I could, with the extinction of your miserable existence, restore\n&#39;, &#39;those victims whom you have so diabolically murdered!”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I expected this reception,” said the dæmon. “All men hate the\n&#39;, &#39;wretched; how, then, must I be hated, who am miserable beyond all\n&#39;, &#39;living things! Yet you, my creator, detest and spurn me, thy creature,\n&#39;, &#39;to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of\n&#39;, &#39;one of us. You purpose to kill me. How dare you sport thus with life?\n&#39;, &#39;Do your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest of\n&#39;, &#39;mankind. If you will comply with my conditions, I will leave them and\n&#39;, &#39;you at peace; but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death, until it\n&#39;, &#39;be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Abhorred monster! Fiend that thou art! The tortures of hell are too\n&#39;, &#39;mild a vengeance for thy crimes. Wretched devil! You reproach me with\n&#39;, &#39;your creation, come on, then, that I may extinguish the spark which I\n&#39;, &#39;so negligently bestowed.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;My rage was without bounds; I sprang on him, impelled by all the\n&#39;, &#39;feelings which can arm one being against the existence of another.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;He easily eluded me and said,\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Be calm! I entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred\n&#39;, &#39;on my devoted head. Have I not suffered enough, that you seek to\n&#39;, &#39;increase my misery? Life, although it may only be an accumulation of\n&#39;, &#39;anguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it. Remember, thou hast made\n&#39;, &#39;me more powerful than thyself; my height is superior to thine, my\n&#39;, &#39;joints more supple. But I will not be tempted to set myself in\n&#39;, &#39;opposition to thee. I am thy creature, and I will be even mild and\n&#39;, &#39;docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part,\n&#39;, &#39;the which thou owest me. Oh, Frankenstein, be not equitable to every\n&#39;, &#39;other and trample upon me alone, to whom thy justice, and even thy\n&#39;, &#39;clemency and affection, is most due. Remember that I am thy creature;\n&#39;, &#39;I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel, whom thou\n&#39;, &#39;drivest from joy for no misdeed. Everywhere I see bliss, from which I\n&#39;, &#39;alone am irrevocably excluded. I was benevolent and good; misery made\n&#39;, &#39;me a fiend. Make me happy, and I shall again be virtuous.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Begone! I will not hear you. There can be no community between you\n&#39;, &#39;and me; we are enemies. Begone, or let us try our strength in a fight,\n&#39;, &#39;in which one must fall.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“How can I move thee? Will no entreaties cause thee to turn a\n&#39;, &#39;favourable eye upon thy creature, who implores thy goodness and\n&#39;, &#39;compassion? Believe me, Frankenstein, I was benevolent; my soul glowed\n&#39;, &#39;with love and humanity; but am I not alone, miserably alone? You, my\n&#39;, &#39;creator, abhor me; what hope can I gather from your fellow creatures,\n&#39;, &#39;who owe me nothing? They spurn and hate me. The desert mountains and\n&#39;, &#39;dreary glaciers are my refuge. I have wandered here many days; the\n&#39;, &#39;caves of ice, which I only do not fear, are a dwelling to me, and the\n&#39;, &#39;only one which man does not grudge. These bleak skies I hail, for they\n&#39;, &#39;are kinder to me than your fellow beings. If the multitude of mankind\n&#39;, &#39;knew of my existence, they would do as you do, and arm themselves for\n&#39;, &#39;my destruction. Shall I not then hate them who abhor me? I will keep\n&#39;, &#39;no terms with my enemies. I am miserable, and they shall share my\n&#39;, &#39;wretchedness. Yet it is in your power to recompense me, and deliver\n&#39;, &#39;them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great, that\n&#39;, &#39;not only you and your family, but thousands of others, shall be\n&#39;, &#39;swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage. Let your compassion be\n&#39;, &#39;moved, and do not disdain me. Listen to my tale; when you have heard\n&#39;, &#39;that, abandon or commiserate me, as you shall judge that I deserve.\n&#39;, &#39;But hear me. The guilty are allowed, by human laws, bloody as they\n&#39;, &#39;are, to speak in their own defence before they are condemned. Listen\n&#39;, &#39;to me, Frankenstein. You accuse me of murder, and yet you would, with\n&#39;, &#39;a satisfied conscience, destroy your own creature. Oh, praise the\n&#39;, &#39;eternal justice of man! Yet I ask you not to spare me; listen to me,\n&#39;, &#39;and then, if you can, and if you will, destroy the work of your hands.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Why do you call to my remembrance,” I rejoined, “circumstances of\n&#39;, &#39;which I shudder to reflect, that I have been the miserable origin and\n&#39;, &#39;author? Cursed be the day, abhorred devil, in which you first saw\n&#39;, &#39;light! Cursed (although I curse myself) be the hands that formed you!\n&#39;, &#39;You have made me wretched beyond expression. You have left me no power\n&#39;, &#39;to consider whether I am just to you or not. Begone! Relieve me from\n&#39;, &#39;the sight of your detested form.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Thus I relieve thee, my creator,” he said, and placed his hated hands\n&#39;, &#39;before my eyes, which I flung from me with violence; “thus I take from\n&#39;, &#39;thee a sight which you abhor. Still thou canst listen to me and grant\n&#39;, &#39;me thy compassion. By the virtues that I once possessed, I demand this\n&#39;, &#39;from you. Hear my tale; it is long and strange, and the temperature of\n&#39;, &#39;this place is not fitting to your fine sensations; come to the hut upon\n&#39;, &#39;the mountain. The sun is yet high in the heavens; before it descends\n&#39;, &#39;to hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another\n&#39;, &#39;world, you will have heard my story and can decide. On you it rests,\n&#39;, &#39;whether I quit for ever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless\n&#39;, &#39;life, or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of\n&#39;, &#39;your own speedy ruin.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;As he said this he led the way across the ice; I followed. My heart\n&#39;, &#39;was full, and I did not answer him, but as I proceeded, I weighed the\n&#39;, &#39;various arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to\n&#39;, &#39;his tale. I was partly urged by curiosity, and compassion confirmed my\n&#39;, &#39;resolution. I had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my\n&#39;, &#39;brother, and I eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion.\n&#39;, &#39;For the first time, also, I felt what the duties of a creator towards\n&#39;, &#39;his creature were, and that I ought to render him happy before I\n&#39;, &#39;complained of his wickedness. These motives urged me to comply with\n&#39;, &#39;his demand. We crossed the ice, therefore, and ascended the opposite\n&#39;, &#39;rock. The air was cold, and the rain again began to descend; we\n&#39;, &#39;entered the hut, the fiend with an air of exultation, I with a heavy\n&#39;, &#39;heart and depressed spirits. But I consented to listen, and seating\n&#39;, &#39;myself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted, he thus began\n&#39;, &#39;his tale.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Chapter 11\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original era of\n&#39;, &#39;my being; all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct.\n&#39;, &#39;A strange multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard,\n&#39;, &#39;and smelt at the same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I\n&#39;, &#39;learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses. By\n&#39;, &#39;degrees, I remember, a stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I\n&#39;, &#39;was obliged to shut my eyes. Darkness then came over me and troubled\n&#39;, &#39;me, but hardly had I felt this when, by opening my eyes, as I now\n&#39;, &#39;suppose, the light poured in upon me again. I walked and, I believe,\n&#39;, &#39;descended, but I presently found a great alteration in my sensations.\n&#39;, &#39;Before, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to my\n&#39;, &#39;touch or sight; but I now found that I could wander on at liberty, with\n&#39;, &#39;no obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid. The light\n&#39;, &#39;became more and more oppressive to me, and the heat wearying me as I\n&#39;, &#39;walked, I sought a place where I could receive shade. This was the\n&#39;, &#39;forest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting\n&#39;, &#39;from my fatigue, until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst. This\n&#39;, &#39;roused me from my nearly dormant state, and I ate some berries which I\n&#39;, &#39;found hanging on the trees or lying on the ground. I slaked my thirst\n&#39;, &#39;at the brook, and then lying down, was overcome by sleep.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“It was dark when I awoke; I felt cold also, and half frightened, as it\n&#39;, &#39;were, instinctively, finding myself so desolate. Before I had quitted\n&#39;, &#39;your apartment, on a sensation of cold, I had covered myself with some\n&#39;, &#39;clothes, but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of\n&#39;, &#39;night. I was a poor, helpless, miserable wretch; I knew, and could\n&#39;, &#39;distinguish, nothing; but feeling pain invade me on all sides, I sat\n&#39;, &#39;down and wept.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of\n&#39;, &#39;pleasure. I started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the\n&#39;, &#39;trees. [The moon] I gazed with a kind of wonder. It moved slowly,\n&#39;, &#39;but it enlightened my path, and I again went out in search of berries.\n&#39;, &#39;I was still cold when under one of the trees I found a huge cloak, with\n&#39;, &#39;which I covered myself, and sat down upon the ground. No distinct\n&#39;, &#39;ideas occupied my mind; all was confused. I felt light, and hunger,\n&#39;, &#39;and thirst, and darkness; innumerable sounds rang in my ears, and on\n&#39;, &#39;all sides various scents saluted me; the only object that I could\n&#39;, &#39;distinguish was the bright moon, and I fixed my eyes on that with\n&#39;, &#39;pleasure.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Several changes of day and night passed, and the orb of night had\n&#39;, &#39;greatly lessened, when I began to distinguish my sensations from each\n&#39;, &#39;other. I gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with\n&#39;, &#39;drink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage. I was delighted\n&#39;, &#39;when I first discovered that a pleasant sound, which often saluted my\n&#39;, &#39;ears, proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had\n&#39;, &#39;often intercepted the light from my eyes. I began also to observe,\n&#39;, &#39;with greater accuracy, the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the\n&#39;, &#39;boundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me. Sometimes I\n&#39;, &#39;tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable.\n&#39;, &#39;Sometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode, but the\n&#39;, &#39;uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into\n&#39;, &#39;silence again.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“The moon had disappeared from the night, and again, with a lessened\n&#39;, &#39;form, showed itself, while I still remained in the forest. My\n&#39;, &#39;sensations had by this time become distinct, and my mind received every\n&#39;, &#39;day additional ideas. My eyes became accustomed to the light and to\n&#39;, &#39;perceive objects in their right forms; I distinguished the insect from\n&#39;, &#39;the herb, and by degrees, one herb from another. I found that the\n&#39;, &#39;sparrow uttered none but harsh notes, whilst those of the blackbird and\n&#39;, &#39;thrush were sweet and enticing.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“One day, when I was oppressed by cold, I found a fire which had been\n&#39;, &#39;left by some wandering beggars, and was overcome with delight at the\n&#39;, &#39;warmth I experienced from it. In my joy I thrust my hand into the live\n&#39;, &#39;embers, but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain. How strange,\n&#39;, &#39;I thought, that the same cause should produce such opposite effects! I\n&#39;, &#39;examined the materials of the fire, and to my joy found it to be\n&#39;, &#39;composed of wood. I quickly collected some branches, but they were wet\n&#39;, &#39;and would not burn. I was pained at this and sat still watching the\n&#39;, &#39;operation of the fire. The wet wood which I had placed near the heat\n&#39;, &#39;dried and itself became inflamed. I reflected on this, and by touching\n&#39;, &#39;the various branches, I discovered the cause and busied myself in\n&#39;, &#39;collecting a great quantity of wood, that I might dry it and have a\n&#39;, &#39;plentiful supply of fire. When night came on and brought sleep with\n&#39;, &#39;it, I was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished. I\n&#39;, &#39;covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches\n&#39;, &#39;upon it; and then, spreading my cloak, I lay on the ground and sank\n&#39;, &#39;into sleep.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“It was morning when I awoke, and my first care was to visit the fire.\n&#39;, &#39;I uncovered it, and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame. I\n&#39;, &#39;observed this also and contrived a fan of branches, which roused the\n&#39;, &#39;embers when they were nearly extinguished. When night came again I\n&#39;, &#39;found, with pleasure, that the fire gave light as well as heat and that\n&#39;, &#39;the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food, for I found\n&#39;, &#39;some of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted, and\n&#39;, &#39;tasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees. I\n&#39;, &#39;tried, therefore, to dress my food in the same manner, placing it on\n&#39;, &#39;the live embers. I found that the berries were spoiled by this\n&#39;, &#39;operation, and the nuts and roots much improved.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Food, however, became scarce, and I often spent the whole day\n&#39;, &#39;searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger. When\n&#39;, &#39;I found this, I resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto\n&#39;, &#39;inhabited, to seek for one where the few wants I experienced would be\n&#39;, &#39;more easily satisfied. In this emigration I exceedingly lamented the\n&#39;, &#39;loss of the fire which I had obtained through accident and knew not how\n&#39;, &#39;to reproduce it. I gave several hours to the serious consideration of\n&#39;, &#39;this difficulty, but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply\n&#39;, &#39;it, and wrapping myself up in my cloak, I struck across the wood\n&#39;, &#39;towards the setting sun. I passed three days in these rambles and at\n&#39;, &#39;length discovered the open country. A great fall of snow had taken\n&#39;, &#39;place the night before, and the fields were of one uniform white; the\n&#39;, &#39;appearance was disconsolate, and I found my feet chilled by the cold\n&#39;, &#39;damp substance that covered the ground.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“It was about seven in the morning, and I longed to obtain food and\n&#39;, &#39;shelter; at length I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which\n&#39;, &#39;had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd. This\n&#39;, &#39;was a new sight to me, and I examined the structure with great\n&#39;, &#39;curiosity. Finding the door open, I entered. An old man sat in it,\n&#39;, &#39;near a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast. He turned on\n&#39;, &#39;hearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting the\n&#39;, &#39;hut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form\n&#39;, &#39;hardly appeared capable. His appearance, different from any I had ever\n&#39;, &#39;before seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me. But I was enchanted\n&#39;, &#39;by the appearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could not\n&#39;, &#39;penetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite\n&#39;, &#39;and divine a retreat as Pandæmonium appeared to the dæmons of hell\n&#39;, &#39;after their sufferings in the lake of fire. I greedily devoured the\n&#39;, &#39;remnants of the shepherd’s breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese,\n&#39;, &#39;milk, and wine; the latter, however, I did not like. Then, overcome by\n&#39;, &#39;fatigue, I lay down among some straw and fell asleep.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“It was noon when I awoke, and allured by the warmth of the sun, which\n&#39;, &#39;shone brightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence my\n&#39;, &#39;travels; and, depositing the remains of the peasant’s breakfast in a\n&#39;, &#39;wallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for several hours, until\n&#39;, &#39;at sunset I arrived at a village. How miraculous did this appear! The\n&#39;, &#39;huts, the neater cottages, and stately houses engaged my admiration by\n&#39;, &#39;turns. The vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw\n&#39;, &#39;placed at the windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite. One\n&#39;, &#39;of the best of these I entered, but I had hardly placed my foot within\n&#39;, &#39;the door before the children shrieked, and one of the women fainted.\n&#39;, &#39;The whole village was roused; some fled, some attacked me, until,\n&#39;, &#39;grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons, I\n&#39;, &#39;escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel,\n&#39;, &#39;quite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had\n&#39;, &#39;beheld in the village. This hovel however, joined a cottage of a neat\n&#39;, &#39;and pleasant appearance, but after my late dearly bought experience, I\n&#39;, &#39;dared not enter it. My place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so\n&#39;, &#39;low that I could with difficulty sit upright in it. No wood, however,\n&#39;, &#39;was placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and\n&#39;, &#39;although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it an\n&#39;, &#39;agreeable asylum from the snow and rain.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Here, then, I retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter,\n&#39;, &#39;however miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still more\n&#39;, &#39;from the barbarity of man. As soon as morning dawned I crept from my\n&#39;, &#39;kennel, that I might view the adjacent cottage and discover if I could\n&#39;, &#39;remain in the habitation I had found. It was situated against the back\n&#39;, &#39;of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig\n&#39;, &#39;sty and a clear pool of water. One part was open, and by that I had\n&#39;, &#39;crept in; but now I covered every crevice by which I might be perceived\n&#39;, &#39;with stones and wood, yet in such a manner that I might move them on\n&#39;, &#39;occasion to pass out; all the light I enjoyed came through the sty, and\n&#39;, &#39;that was sufficient for me.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw, I\n&#39;, &#39;retired, for I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I remembered\n&#39;, &#39;too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power. I\n&#39;, &#39;had first, however, provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf\n&#39;, &#39;of coarse bread, which I purloined, and a cup with which I could drink\n&#39;, &#39;more conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by\n&#39;, &#39;my retreat. The floor was a little raised, so that it was kept\n&#39;, &#39;perfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was\n&#39;, &#39;tolerably warm.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Being thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel until\n&#39;, &#39;something should occur which might alter my determination. It was\n&#39;, &#39;indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest, my former residence,\n&#39;, &#39;the rain-dropping branches, and dank earth. I ate my breakfast with\n&#39;, &#39;pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little\n&#39;, &#39;water when I heard a step, and looking through a small chink, I beheld\n&#39;, &#39;a young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel. The\n&#39;, &#39;girl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since found\n&#39;, &#39;cottagers and farmhouse servants to be. Yet she was meanly dressed, a\n&#39;, &#39;coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair\n&#39;, &#39;hair was plaited but not adorned: she looked patient yet sad. I lost\n&#39;, &#39;sight of her, and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing\n&#39;, &#39;the pail, which was now partly filled with milk. As she walked along,\n&#39;, &#39;seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose\n&#39;, &#39;countenance expressed a deeper despondence. Uttering a few sounds with\n&#39;, &#39;an air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head and bore it to the\n&#39;, &#39;cottage himself. She followed, and they disappeared. Presently I saw\n&#39;, &#39;the young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field\n&#39;, &#39;behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the\n&#39;, &#39;house and sometimes in the yard.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“On examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of the\n&#39;, &#39;cottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been\n&#39;, &#39;filled up with wood. In one of these was a small and almost\n&#39;, &#39;imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate.\n&#39;, &#39;Through this crevice a small room was visible, whitewashed and clean\n&#39;, &#39;but very bare of furniture. In one corner, near a small fire, sat an\n&#39;, &#39;old man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude. The\n&#39;, &#39;young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she\n&#39;, &#39;took something out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat\n&#39;, &#39;down beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play\n&#39;, &#39;and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the\n&#39;, &#39;nightingale. It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who had\n&#39;, &#39;never beheld aught beautiful before. The silver hair and benevolent\n&#39;, &#39;countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentle\n&#39;, &#39;manners of the girl enticed my love. He played a sweet mournful air\n&#39;, &#39;which I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of\n&#39;, &#39;which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then\n&#39;, &#39;pronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt\n&#39;, &#39;at his feet. He raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection\n&#39;, &#39;that I felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature; they were\n&#39;, &#39;a mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had never before experienced,\n&#39;, &#39;either from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and I withdrew from the\n&#39;, &#39;window, unable to bear these emotions.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Soon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a\n&#39;, &#39;load of wood. The girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of\n&#39;, &#39;his burden, and taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on\n&#39;, &#39;the fire; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage,\n&#39;, &#39;and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese. She seemed\n&#39;, &#39;pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she\n&#39;, &#39;placed in water, and then upon the fire. She afterwards continued her\n&#39;, &#39;work, whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily\n&#39;, &#39;employed in digging and pulling up roots. After he had been employed\n&#39;, &#39;thus about an hour, the young woman joined him and they entered the\n&#39;, &#39;cottage together.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“The old man had, in the meantime, been pensive, but on the appearance\n&#39;, &#39;of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to\n&#39;, &#39;eat. The meal was quickly dispatched. The young woman was again\n&#39;, &#39;occupied in arranging the cottage, the old man walked before the\n&#39;, &#39;cottage in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth.\n&#39;, &#39;Nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent\n&#39;, &#39;creatures. One was old, with silver hairs and a countenance beaming\n&#39;, &#39;with benevolence and love; the younger was slight and graceful in his\n&#39;, &#39;figure, and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry, yet his\n&#39;, &#39;eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency. The\n&#39;, &#39;old man returned to the cottage, and the youth, with tools different\n&#39;, &#39;from those he had used in the morning, directed his steps across the\n&#39;, &#39;fields.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Night quickly shut in, but to my extreme wonder, I found that the\n&#39;, &#39;cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers, and was\n&#39;, &#39;delighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the\n&#39;, &#39;pleasure I experienced in watching my human neighbours. In the evening\n&#39;, &#39;the young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations\n&#39;, &#39;which I did not understand; and the old man again took up the\n&#39;, &#39;instrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in\n&#39;, &#39;the morning. So soon as he had finished, the youth began, not to play,\n&#39;, &#39;but to utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling the\n&#39;, &#39;harmony of the old man’s instrument nor the songs of the birds; I since\n&#39;, &#39;found that he read aloud, but at that time I knew nothing of the\n&#39;, &#39;science of words or letters.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“The family, after having been thus occupied for a short time,\n&#39;, &#39;extinguished their lights and retired, as I conjectured, to rest.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Chapter 12\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I lay on my straw, but I could not sleep. I thought of the\n&#39;, &#39;occurrences of the day. What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners\n&#39;, &#39;of these people, and I longed to join them, but dared not. I\n&#39;, &#39;remembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before from\n&#39;, &#39;the barbarous villagers, and resolved, whatever course of conduct I\n&#39;, &#39;might hereafter think it right to pursue, that for the present I would\n&#39;, &#39;remain quietly in my hovel, watching and endeavouring to discover the\n&#39;, &#39;motives which influenced their actions.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun. The young woman\n&#39;, &#39;arranged the cottage and prepared the food, and the youth departed\n&#39;, &#39;after the first meal.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it.\n&#39;, &#39;The young man was constantly employed out of doors, and the girl in\n&#39;, &#39;various laborious occupations within. The old man, whom I soon\n&#39;, &#39;perceived to be blind, employed his leisure hours on his instrument or\n&#39;, &#39;in contemplation. Nothing could exceed the love and respect which the\n&#39;, &#39;younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion. They\n&#39;, &#39;performed towards him every little office of affection and duty with\n&#39;, &#39;gentleness, and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“They were not entirely happy. The young man and his companion often\n&#39;, &#39;went apart and appeared to weep. I saw no cause for their unhappiness,\n&#39;, &#39;but I was deeply affected by it. If such lovely creatures were\n&#39;, &#39;miserable, it was less strange that I, an imperfect and solitary being,\n&#39;, &#39;should be wretched. Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy? They\n&#39;, &#39;possessed a delightful house (for such it was in my eyes) and every\n&#39;, &#39;luxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands\n&#39;, &#39;when hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and, still more,\n&#39;, &#39;they enjoyed one another’s company and speech, interchanging each day\n&#39;, &#39;looks of affection and kindness. What did their tears imply? Did they\n&#39;, &#39;really express pain? I was at first unable to solve these questions,\n&#39;, &#39;but perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which\n&#39;, &#39;were at first enigmatic.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of\n&#39;, &#39;the uneasiness of this amiable family: it was poverty, and they\n&#39;, &#39;suffered that evil in a very distressing degree. Their nourishment\n&#39;, &#39;consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of\n&#39;, &#39;one cow, which gave very little during the winter, when its masters\n&#39;, &#39;could scarcely procure food to support it. They often, I believe,\n&#39;, &#39;suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly, especially the two\n&#39;, &#39;younger cottagers, for several times they placed food before the old\n&#39;, &#39;man when they reserved none for themselves.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“This trait of kindness moved me sensibly. I had been accustomed,\n&#39;, &#39;during the night, to steal a part of their store for my own\n&#39;, &#39;consumption, but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on\n&#39;, &#39;the cottagers, I abstained and satisfied myself with berries, nuts, and\n&#39;, &#39;roots which I gathered from a neighbouring wood.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist\n&#39;, &#39;their labours. I found that the youth spent a great part of each day\n&#39;, &#39;in collecting wood for the family fire, and during the night I often\n&#39;, &#39;took his tools, the use of which I quickly discovered, and brought home\n&#39;, &#39;firing sufficient for the consumption of several days.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I remember, the first time that I did this, the young woman, when she\n&#39;, &#39;opened the door in the morning, appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great\n&#39;, &#39;pile of wood on the outside. She uttered some words in a loud voice, and the\n&#39;, &#39;youth joined her, who also expressed surprise. I observed, with pleasure,\n&#39;, &#39;that he did not go to the forest that day, but spent it in repairing the\n&#39;, &#39;cottage and cultivating the garden.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“By degrees I made a discovery of still greater moment. I found that\n&#39;, &#39;these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and\n&#39;, &#39;feelings to one another by articulate sounds. I perceived that the words\n&#39;, &#39;they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain, smiles or sadness, in the\n&#39;, &#39;minds and countenances of the hearers. This was indeed a godlike science,\n&#39;, &#39;and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it. But I was baffled in\n&#39;, &#39;every attempt I made for this purpose. Their pronunciation was quick, and\n&#39;, &#39;the words they uttered, not having any apparent connection with visible\n&#39;, &#39;objects, I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the\n&#39;, &#39;mystery of their reference. By great application, however, and after having\n&#39;, &#39;remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel, I\n&#39;, &#39;discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of\n&#39;, &#39;discourse; I learned and applied the words, _fire, milk, bread,_ and\n&#39;, &#39;_wood._ I learned also the names of the cottagers themselves. The youth\n&#39;, &#39;and his companion had each of them several names, but the old man had only\n&#39;, &#39;one, which was _father._ The girl was called _sister_ or\n&#39;, &#39;_Agatha,_ and the youth _Felix, brother,_ or _son_. I cannot\n&#39;, &#39;describe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each of\n&#39;, &#39;these sounds and was able to pronounce them. I distinguished several other\n&#39;, &#39;words without being able as yet to understand or apply them, such as _good,\n&#39;, &#39;dearest, unhappy._\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I spent the winter in this manner. The gentle manners and beauty of\n&#39;, &#39;the cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy, I\n&#39;, &#39;felt depressed; when they rejoiced, I sympathised in their joys. I saw\n&#39;, &#39;few human beings besides them, and if any other happened to enter the\n&#39;, &#39;cottage, their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the\n&#39;, &#39;superior accomplishments of my friends. The old man, I could perceive,\n&#39;, &#39;often endeavoured to encourage his children, as sometimes I found that\n&#39;, &#39;he called them, to cast off their melancholy. He would talk in a\n&#39;, &#39;cheerful accent, with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure\n&#39;, &#39;even upon me. Agatha listened with respect, her eyes sometimes filled\n&#39;, &#39;with tears, which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I\n&#39;, &#39;generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after\n&#39;, &#39;having listened to the exhortations of her father. It was not thus\n&#39;, &#39;with Felix. He was always the saddest of the group, and even to my\n&#39;, &#39;unpractised senses, he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his\n&#39;, &#39;friends. But if his countenance was more sorrowful, his voice was more\n&#39;, &#39;cheerful than that of his sister, especially when he addressed the old\n&#39;, &#39;man.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I could mention innumerable instances which, although slight, marked\n&#39;, &#39;the dispositions of these amiable cottagers. In the midst of poverty\n&#39;, &#39;and want, Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little\n&#39;, &#39;white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground. Early in\n&#39;, &#39;the morning, before she had risen, he cleared away the snow that\n&#39;, &#39;obstructed her path to the milk-house, drew water from the well, and\n&#39;, &#39;brought the wood from the outhouse, where, to his perpetual\n&#39;, &#39;astonishment, he found his store always replenished by an invisible\n&#39;, &#39;hand. In the day, I believe, he worked sometimes for a neighbouring\n&#39;, &#39;farmer, because he often went forth and did not return until dinner,\n&#39;, &#39;yet brought no wood with him. At other times he worked in the garden,\n&#39;, &#39;but as there was little to do in the frosty season, he read to the old\n&#39;, &#39;man and Agatha.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“This reading had puzzled me extremely at first, but by degrees I\n&#39;, &#39;discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when\n&#39;, &#39;he talked. I conjectured, therefore, that he found on the paper signs\n&#39;, &#39;for speech which he understood, and I ardently longed to comprehend\n&#39;, &#39;these also; but how was that possible when I did not even understand\n&#39;, &#39;the sounds for which they stood as signs? I improved, however,\n&#39;, &#39;sensibly in this science, but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of\n&#39;, &#39;conversation, although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour, for I\n&#39;, &#39;easily perceived that, although I eagerly longed to discover myself to\n&#39;, &#39;the cottagers, I ought not to make the attempt until I had first become\n&#39;, &#39;master of their language, which knowledge might enable me to make them\n&#39;, &#39;overlook the deformity of my figure, for with this also the contrast\n&#39;, &#39;perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagers—their grace, beauty,\n&#39;, &#39;and delicate complexions; but how was I terrified when I viewed myself\n&#39;, &#39;in a transparent pool! At first I started back, unable to believe that\n&#39;, &#39;it was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became\n&#39;, &#39;fully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am, I was\n&#39;, &#39;filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification.\n&#39;, &#39;Alas! I did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable\n&#39;, &#39;deformity.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“As the sun became warmer and the light of day longer, the snow\n&#39;, &#39;vanished, and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth. From this\n&#39;, &#39;time Felix was more employed, and the heart-moving indications of\n&#39;, &#39;impending famine disappeared. Their food, as I afterwards found, was\n&#39;, &#39;coarse, but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it.\n&#39;, &#39;Several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden, which they\n&#39;, &#39;dressed; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season\n&#39;, &#39;advanced.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“The old man, leaning on his son, walked each day at noon, when it did\n&#39;, &#39;not rain, as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its\n&#39;, &#39;waters. This frequently took place, but a high wind quickly dried the\n&#39;, &#39;earth, and the season became far more pleasant than it had been.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“My mode of life in my hovel was uniform. During the morning I\n&#39;, &#39;attended the motions of the cottagers, and when they were dispersed in\n&#39;, &#39;various occupations, I slept; the remainder of the day was spent in\n&#39;, &#39;observing my friends. When they had retired to rest, if there was any\n&#39;, &#39;moon or the night was star-light, I went into the woods and collected\n&#39;, &#39;my own food and fuel for the cottage. When I returned, as often as it\n&#39;, &#39;was necessary, I cleared their path from the snow and performed those\n&#39;, &#39;offices that I had seen done by Felix. I afterwards found that these\n&#39;, &#39;labours, performed by an invisible hand, greatly astonished them; and\n&#39;, &#39;once or twice I heard them, on these occasions, utter the words _good\n&#39;, &#39;spirit, wonderful_; but I did not then understand the signification\n&#39;, &#39;of these terms.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“My thoughts now became more active, and I longed to discover the\n&#39;, &#39;motives and feelings of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to\n&#39;, &#39;know why Felix appeared so miserable and Agatha so sad. I thought\n&#39;, &#39;(foolish wretch!) that it might be in my power to restore happiness to\n&#39;, &#39;these deserving people. When I slept or was absent, the forms of the\n&#39;, &#39;venerable blind father, the gentle Agatha, and the excellent Felix\n&#39;, &#39;flitted before me. I looked upon them as superior beings who would be\n&#39;, &#39;the arbiters of my future destiny. I formed in my imagination a\n&#39;, &#39;thousand pictures of presenting myself to them, and their reception of\n&#39;, &#39;me. I imagined that they would be disgusted, until, by my gentle\n&#39;, &#39;demeanour and conciliating words, I should first win their favour and\n&#39;, &#39;afterwards their love.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“These thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to\n&#39;, &#39;the acquiring the art of language. My organs were indeed harsh, but\n&#39;, &#39;supple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their\n&#39;, &#39;tones, yet I pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease.\n&#39;, &#39;It was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose\n&#39;, &#39;intentions were affectionate, although his manners were rude, deserved\n&#39;, &#39;better treatment than blows and execration.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“The pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the\n&#39;, &#39;aspect of the earth. Men who before this change seemed to have been\n&#39;, &#39;hid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of\n&#39;, &#39;cultivation. The birds sang in more cheerful notes, and the leaves\n&#39;, &#39;began to bud forth on the trees. Happy, happy earth! Fit habitation\n&#39;, &#39;for gods, which, so short a time before, was bleak, damp, and\n&#39;, &#39;unwholesome. My spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of\n&#39;, &#39;nature; the past was blotted from my memory, the present was tranquil,\n&#39;, &#39;and the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Chapter 13\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I now hasten to the more moving part of my story. I shall relate\n&#39;, &#39;events that impressed me with feelings which, from what I had been,\n&#39;, &#39;have made me what I am.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Spring advanced rapidly; the weather became fine and the skies\n&#39;, &#39;cloudless. It surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy\n&#39;, &#39;should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure. My\n&#39;, &#39;senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and\n&#39;, &#39;a thousand sights of beauty.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“It was on one of these days, when my cottagers periodically rested\n&#39;, &#39;from labour—the old man played on his guitar, and the children\n&#39;, &#39;listened to him—that I observed the countenance of Felix was\n&#39;, &#39;melancholy beyond expression; he sighed frequently, and once his father\n&#39;, &#39;paused in his music, and I conjectured by his manner that he inquired\n&#39;, &#39;the cause of his son’s sorrow. Felix replied in a cheerful accent, and\n&#39;, &#39;the old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“It was a lady on horseback, accompanied by a country-man as a guide.\n&#39;, &#39;The lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black\n&#39;, &#39;veil. Agatha asked a question, to which the stranger only replied by\n&#39;, &#39;pronouncing, in a sweet accent, the name of Felix. Her voice was\n&#39;, &#39;musical but unlike that of either of my friends. On hearing this word,\n&#39;, &#39;Felix came up hastily to the lady, who, when she saw him, threw up her\n&#39;, &#39;veil, and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression. Her\n&#39;, &#39;hair of a shining raven black, and curiously braided; her eyes were\n&#39;, &#39;dark, but gentle, although animated; her features of a regular\n&#39;, &#39;proportion, and her complexion wondrously fair, each cheek tinged with\n&#39;, &#39;a lovely pink.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her, every trait of\n&#39;, &#39;sorrow vanished from his face, and it instantly expressed a degree of\n&#39;, &#39;ecstatic joy, of which I could hardly have believed it capable; his\n&#39;, &#39;eyes sparkled, as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I\n&#39;, &#39;thought him as beautiful as the stranger. She appeared affected by\n&#39;, &#39;different feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes, she held\n&#39;, &#39;out her hand to Felix, who kissed it rapturously and called her, as\n&#39;, &#39;well as I could distinguish, his sweet Arabian. She did not appear to\n&#39;, &#39;understand him, but smiled. He assisted her to dismount, and\n&#39;, &#39;dismissing her guide, conducted her into the cottage. Some\n&#39;, &#39;conversation took place between him and his father, and the young\n&#39;, &#39;stranger knelt at the old man’s feet and would have kissed his hand,\n&#39;, &#39;but he raised her and embraced her affectionately.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds\n&#39;, &#39;and appeared to have a language of her own, she was neither understood\n&#39;, &#39;by nor herself understood the cottagers. They made many signs which I\n&#39;, &#39;did not comprehend, but I saw that her presence diffused gladness\n&#39;, &#39;through the cottage, dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the\n&#39;, &#39;morning mists. Felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of\n&#39;, &#39;delight welcomed his Arabian. Agatha, the ever-gentle Agatha, kissed\n&#39;, &#39;the hands of the lovely stranger, and pointing to her brother, made\n&#39;, &#39;signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she\n&#39;, &#39;came. Some hours passed thus, while they, by their countenances,\n&#39;, &#39;expressed joy, the cause of which I did not comprehend. Presently I\n&#39;, &#39;found, by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger\n&#39;, &#39;repeated after them, that she was endeavouring to learn their language;\n&#39;, &#39;and the idea instantly occurred to me that I should make use of the\n&#39;, &#39;same instructions to the same end. The stranger learned about twenty\n&#39;, &#39;words at the first lesson; most of them, indeed, were those which I had\n&#39;, &#39;before understood, but I profited by the others.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“As night came on, Agatha and the Arabian retired early. When they\n&#39;, &#39;separated Felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said, ‘Good night\n&#39;, &#39;sweet Safie.’ He sat up much longer, conversing with his father, and\n&#39;, &#39;by the frequent repetition of her name I conjectured that their lovely\n&#39;, &#39;guest was the subject of their conversation. I ardently desired to\n&#39;, &#39;understand them, and bent every faculty towards that purpose, but found\n&#39;, &#39;it utterly impossible.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“The next morning Felix went out to his work, and after the usual\n&#39;, &#39;occupations of Agatha were finished, the Arabian sat at the feet of the\n&#39;, &#39;old man, and taking his guitar, played some airs so entrancingly\n&#39;, &#39;beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my\n&#39;, &#39;eyes. She sang, and her voice flowed in a rich cadence, swelling or\n&#39;, &#39;dying away like a nightingale of the woods.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“When she had finished, she gave the guitar to Agatha, who at first\n&#39;, &#39;declined it. She played a simple air, and her voice accompanied it in\n&#39;, &#39;sweet accents, but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger. The old\n&#39;, &#39;man appeared enraptured and said some words which Agatha endeavoured to\n&#39;, &#39;explain to Safie, and by which he appeared to wish to express that she\n&#39;, &#39;bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“The days now passed as peaceably as before, with the sole alteration\n&#39;, &#39;that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends.\n&#39;, &#39;Safie was always gay and happy; she and I improved rapidly in the\n&#39;, &#39;knowledge of language, so that in two months I began to comprehend most\n&#39;, &#39;of the words uttered by my protectors.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“In the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage, and\n&#39;, &#39;the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers, sweet to the\n&#39;, &#39;scent and the eyes, stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods;\n&#39;, &#39;the sun became warmer, the nights clear and balmy; and my nocturnal\n&#39;, &#39;rambles were an extreme pleasure to me, although they were considerably\n&#39;, &#39;shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun, for I never\n&#39;, &#39;ventured abroad during daylight, fearful of meeting with the same\n&#39;, &#39;treatment I had formerly endured in the first village which I entered.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“My days were spent in close attention, that I might more speedily\n&#39;, &#39;master the language; and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than\n&#39;, &#39;the Arabian, who understood very little and conversed in broken\n&#39;, &#39;accents, whilst I comprehended and could imitate almost every word that\n&#39;, &#39;was spoken.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“While I improved in speech, I also learned the science of letters as\n&#39;, &#39;it was taught to the stranger, and this opened before me a wide field\n&#39;, &#39;for wonder and delight.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“The book from which Felix instructed Safie was Volney’s _Ruins\n&#39;, &#39;of Empires_. I should not have understood the purport of this book had not\n&#39;, &#39;Felix, in reading it, given very minute explanations. He had chosen this\n&#39;, &#39;work, he said, because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the\n&#39;, &#39;Eastern authors. Through this work I obtained a cursory knowledge of history\n&#39;, &#39;and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world; it gave\n&#39;, &#39;me an insight into the manners, governments, and religions of the different\n&#39;, &#39;nations of the earth. I heard of the slothful Asiatics, of the stupendous\n&#39;, &#39;genius and mental activity of the Grecians, of the wars and wonderful virtue\n&#39;, &#39;of the early Romans—of their subsequent degenerating—of the\n&#39;, &#39;decline of that mighty empire, of chivalry, Christianity, and kings. I heard\n&#39;, &#39;of the discovery of the American hemisphere and wept with Safie over the\n&#39;, &#39;hapless fate of its original inhabitants.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“These wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings. Was\n&#39;, &#39;man, indeed, at once so powerful, so virtuous and magnificent, yet so\n&#39;, &#39;vicious and base? He appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil\n&#39;, &#39;principle and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and\n&#39;, &#39;godlike. To be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour\n&#39;, &#39;that can befall a sensitive being; to be base and vicious, as many on\n&#39;, &#39;record have been, appeared the lowest degradation, a condition more\n&#39;, &#39;abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm. For a long time I\n&#39;, &#39;could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow, or\n&#39;, &#39;even why there were laws and governments; but when I heard details of\n&#39;, &#39;vice and bloodshed, my wonder ceased and I turned away with disgust and\n&#39;, &#39;loathing.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me.\n&#39;, &#39;While I listened to the instructions which Felix bestowed upon the\n&#39;, &#39;Arabian, the strange system of human society was explained to me. I\n&#39;, &#39;heard of the division of property, of immense wealth and squalid\n&#39;, &#39;poverty, of rank, descent, and noble blood.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“The words induced me to turn towards myself. I learned that the\n&#39;, &#39;possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and\n&#39;, &#39;unsullied descent united with riches. A man might be respected with\n&#39;, &#39;only one of these advantages, but without either he was considered,\n&#39;, &#39;except in very rare instances, as a vagabond and a slave, doomed to\n&#39;, &#39;waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few! And what was I? Of\n&#39;, &#39;my creation and creator I was absolutely ignorant, but I knew that I\n&#39;, &#39;possessed no money, no friends, no kind of property. I was, besides,\n&#39;, &#39;endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome; I was not even\n&#39;, &#39;of the same nature as man. I was more agile than they and could\n&#39;, &#39;subsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with\n&#39;, &#39;less injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded theirs. When I looked\n&#39;, &#39;around I saw and heard of none like me. Was I, then, a monster, a blot\n&#39;, &#39;upon the earth, from which all men fled and whom all men disowned?\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted\n&#39;, &#39;upon me; I tried to dispel them, but sorrow only increased with\n&#39;, &#39;knowledge. Oh, that I had for ever remained in my native wood, nor\n&#39;, &#39;known nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger, thirst, and heat!\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Of what a strange nature is knowledge! It clings to the mind when it\n&#39;, &#39;has once seized on it like a lichen on the rock. I wished sometimes to\n&#39;, &#39;shake off all thought and feeling, but I learned that there was but one\n&#39;, &#39;means to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death—a state\n&#39;, &#39;which I feared yet did not understand. I admired virtue and good\n&#39;, &#39;feelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my\n&#39;, &#39;cottagers, but I was shut out from intercourse with them, except\n&#39;, &#39;through means which I obtained by stealth, when I was unseen and\n&#39;, &#39;unknown, and which rather increased than satisfied the desire I had of\n&#39;, &#39;becoming one among my fellows. The gentle words of Agatha and the\n&#39;, &#39;animated smiles of the charming Arabian were not for me. The mild\n&#39;, &#39;exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved\n&#39;, &#39;Felix were not for me. Miserable, unhappy wretch!\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply. I heard of the\n&#39;, &#39;difference of sexes, and the birth and growth of children, how the\n&#39;, &#39;father doted on the smiles of the infant, and the lively sallies of the\n&#39;, &#39;older child, how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up\n&#39;, &#39;in the precious charge, how the mind of youth expanded and gained\n&#39;, &#39;knowledge, of brother, sister, and all the various relationships which\n&#39;, &#39;bind one human being to another in mutual bonds.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“But where were my friends and relations? No father had watched my\n&#39;, &#39;infant days, no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses; or if\n&#39;, &#39;they had, all my past life was now a blot, a blind vacancy in which I\n&#39;, &#39;distinguished nothing. From my earliest remembrance I had been as I\n&#39;, &#39;then was in height and proportion. I had never yet seen a being\n&#39;, &#39;resembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me. What was I? The\n&#39;, &#39;question again recurred, to be answered only with groans.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I will soon explain to what these feelings tended, but allow me now to\n&#39;, &#39;return to the cottagers, whose story excited in me such various\n&#39;, &#39;feelings of indignation, delight, and wonder, but which all terminated\n&#39;, &#39;in additional love and reverence for my protectors (for so I loved, in\n&#39;, &#39;an innocent, half-painful self-deceit, to call them).”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Chapter 14\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Some time elapsed before I learned the history of my friends. It was\n&#39;, &#39;one which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind, unfolding\n&#39;, &#39;as it did a number of circumstances, each interesting and wonderful to\n&#39;, &#39;one so utterly inexperienced as I was.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“The name of the old man was De Lacey. He was descended from a good\n&#39;, &#39;family in France, where he had lived for many years in affluence,\n&#39;, &#39;respected by his superiors and beloved by his equals. His son was bred\n&#39;, &#39;in the service of his country, and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the\n&#39;, &#39;highest distinction. A few months before my arrival they had lived in\n&#39;, &#39;a large and luxurious city called Paris, surrounded by friends and\n&#39;, &#39;possessed of every enjoyment which virtue, refinement of intellect, or\n&#39;, &#39;taste, accompanied by a moderate fortune, could afford.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“The father of Safie had been the cause of their ruin. He was a\n&#39;, &#39;Turkish merchant and had inhabited Paris for many years, when, for some\n&#39;, &#39;reason which I could not learn, he became obnoxious to the government.\n&#39;, &#39;He was seized and cast into prison the very day that Safie arrived from\n&#39;, &#39;Constantinople to join him. He was tried and condemned to death. The\n&#39;, &#39;injustice of his sentence was very flagrant; all Paris was indignant;\n&#39;, &#39;and it was judged that his religion and wealth rather than the crime\n&#39;, &#39;alleged against him had been the cause of his condemnation.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Felix had accidentally been present at the trial; his horror and\n&#39;, &#39;indignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the\n&#39;, &#39;court. He made, at that moment, a solemn vow to deliver him and then\n&#39;, &#39;looked around for the means. After many fruitless attempts to gain\n&#39;, &#39;admittance to the prison, he found a strongly grated window in an\n&#39;, &#39;unguarded part of the building, which lighted the dungeon of the\n&#39;, &#39;unfortunate Muhammadan, who, loaded with chains, waited in despair the\n&#39;, &#39;execution of the barbarous sentence. Felix visited the grate at night\n&#39;, &#39;and made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour. The Turk,\n&#39;, &#39;amazed and delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer\n&#39;, &#39;by promises of reward and wealth. Felix rejected his offers with\n&#39;, &#39;contempt, yet when he saw the lovely Safie, who was allowed to visit\n&#39;, &#39;her father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude, the\n&#39;, &#39;youth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed\n&#39;, &#39;a treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“The Turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made\n&#39;, &#39;on the heart of Felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in\n&#39;, &#39;his interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon as he\n&#39;, &#39;should be conveyed to a place of safety. Felix was too delicate to\n&#39;, &#39;accept this offer, yet he looked forward to the probability of the\n&#39;, &#39;event as to the consummation of his happiness.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“During the ensuing days, while the preparations were going forward for\n&#39;, &#39;the escape of the merchant, the zeal of Felix was warmed by several\n&#39;, &#39;letters that he received from this lovely girl, who found means to\n&#39;, &#39;express her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old\n&#39;, &#39;man, a servant of her father who understood French. She thanked him in\n&#39;, &#39;the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent, and\n&#39;, &#39;at the same time she gently deplored her own fate.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I have copies of these letters, for I found means, during my residence\n&#39;, &#39;in the hovel, to procure the implements of writing; and the letters\n&#39;, &#39;were often in the hands of Felix or Agatha. Before I depart I will\n&#39;, &#39;give them to you; they will prove the truth of my tale; but at present,\n&#39;, &#39;as the sun is already far declined, I shall only have time to repeat\n&#39;, &#39;the substance of them to you.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Safie related that her mother was a Christian Arab, seized and made a\n&#39;, &#39;slave by the Turks; recommended by her beauty, she had won the heart of\n&#39;, &#39;the father of Safie, who married her. The young girl spoke in high and\n&#39;, &#39;enthusiastic terms of her mother, who, born in freedom, spurned the\n&#39;, &#39;bondage to which she was now reduced. She instructed her daughter in\n&#39;, &#39;the tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of\n&#39;, &#39;intellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female\n&#39;, &#39;followers of Muhammad. This lady died, but her lessons were indelibly\n&#39;, &#39;impressed on the mind of Safie, who sickened at the prospect of again\n&#39;, &#39;returning to Asia and being immured within the walls of a harem,\n&#39;, &#39;allowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements, ill-suited to\n&#39;, &#39;the temper of her soul, now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble\n&#39;, &#39;emulation for virtue. The prospect of marrying a Christian and\n&#39;, &#39;remaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in\n&#39;, &#39;society was enchanting to her.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“The day for the execution of the Turk was fixed, but on the night\n&#39;, &#39;previous to it he quitted his prison and before morning was distant\n&#39;, &#39;many leagues from Paris. Felix had procured passports in the name of\n&#39;, &#39;his father, sister, and himself. He had previously communicated his\n&#39;, &#39;plan to the former, who aided the deceit by quitting his house, under\n&#39;, &#39;the pretence of a journey and concealed himself, with his daughter, in\n&#39;, &#39;an obscure part of Paris.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Felix conducted the fugitives through France to Lyons and across Mont\n&#39;, &#39;Cenis to Leghorn, where the merchant had decided to wait a favourable\n&#39;, &#39;opportunity of passing into some part of the Turkish dominions.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his\n&#39;, &#39;departure, before which time the Turk renewed his promise that she\n&#39;, &#39;should be united to his deliverer; and Felix remained with them in\n&#39;, &#39;expectation of that event; and in the meantime he enjoyed the society\n&#39;, &#39;of the Arabian, who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest\n&#39;, &#39;affection. They conversed with one another through the means of an\n&#39;, &#39;interpreter, and sometimes with the interpretation of looks; and Safie\n&#39;, &#39;sang to him the divine airs of her native country.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“The Turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes\n&#39;, &#39;of the youthful lovers, while in his heart he had formed far other\n&#39;, &#39;plans. He loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a\n&#39;, &#39;Christian, but he feared the resentment of Felix if he should appear\n&#39;, &#39;lukewarm, for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer\n&#39;, &#39;if he should choose to betray him to the Italian state which they\n&#39;, &#39;inhabited. He revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled\n&#39;, &#39;to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary, and\n&#39;, &#39;secretly to take his daughter with him when he departed. His plans\n&#39;, &#39;were facilitated by the news which arrived from Paris.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“The government of France were greatly enraged at the escape of their\n&#39;, &#39;victim and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer. The\n&#39;, &#39;plot of Felix was quickly discovered, and De Lacey and Agatha were\n&#39;, &#39;thrown into prison. The news reached Felix and roused him from his\n&#39;, &#39;dream of pleasure. His blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay\n&#39;, &#39;in a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of\n&#39;, &#39;her whom he loved. This idea was torture to him. He quickly arranged\n&#39;, &#39;with the Turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity\n&#39;, &#39;for escape before Felix could return to Italy, Safie should remain as a\n&#39;, &#39;boarder at a convent at Leghorn; and then, quitting the lovely Arabian,\n&#39;, &#39;he hastened to Paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the\n&#39;, &#39;law, hoping to free De Lacey and Agatha by this proceeding.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“He did not succeed. They remained confined for five months before the\n&#39;, &#39;trial took place, the result of which deprived them of their fortune\n&#39;, &#39;and condemned them to a perpetual exile from their native country.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“They found a miserable asylum in the cottage in Germany, where I\n&#39;, &#39;discovered them. Felix soon learned that the treacherous Turk, for\n&#39;, &#39;whom he and his family endured such unheard-of oppression, on\n&#39;, &#39;discovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin,\n&#39;, &#39;became a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted Italy with\n&#39;, &#39;his daughter, insultingly sending Felix a pittance of money to aid him,\n&#39;, &#39;as he said, in some plan of future maintenance.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Such were the events that preyed on the heart of Felix and rendered\n&#39;, &#39;him, when I first saw him, the most miserable of his family. He could\n&#39;, &#39;have endured poverty, and while this distress had been the meed of his\n&#39;, &#39;virtue, he gloried in it; but the ingratitude of the Turk and the loss\n&#39;, &#39;of his beloved Safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable. The\n&#39;, &#39;arrival of the Arabian now infused new life into his soul.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“When the news reached Leghorn that Felix was deprived of his wealth\n&#39;, &#39;and rank, the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her\n&#39;, &#39;lover, but to prepare to return to her native country. The generous\n&#39;, &#39;nature of Safie was outraged by this command; she attempted to\n&#39;, &#39;expostulate with her father, but he left her angrily, reiterating his\n&#39;, &#39;tyrannical mandate.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“A few days after, the Turk entered his daughter’s apartment and told\n&#39;, &#39;her hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at Leghorn\n&#39;, &#39;had been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the\n&#39;, &#39;French government; he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to\n&#39;, &#39;Constantinople, for which city he should sail in a few hours. He\n&#39;, &#39;intended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential\n&#39;, &#39;servant, to follow at her leisure with the greater part of his\n&#39;, &#39;property, which had not yet arrived at Leghorn.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“When alone, Safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it\n&#39;, &#39;would become her to pursue in this emergency. A residence in Turkey\n&#39;, &#39;was abhorrent to her; her religion and her feelings were alike averse\n&#39;, &#39;to it. By some papers of her father which fell into her hands she\n&#39;, &#39;heard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where\n&#39;, &#39;he then resided. She hesitated some time, but at length she formed her\n&#39;, &#39;determination. Taking with her some jewels that belonged to her and a\n&#39;, &#39;sum of money, she quitted Italy with an attendant, a native of Leghorn,\n&#39;, &#39;but who understood the common language of Turkey, and departed for\n&#39;, &#39;Germany.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“She arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage\n&#39;, &#39;of De Lacey, when her attendant fell dangerously ill. Safie nursed her\n&#39;, &#39;with the most devoted affection, but the poor girl died, and the\n&#39;, &#39;Arabian was left alone, unacquainted with the language of the country\n&#39;, &#39;and utterly ignorant of the customs of the world. She fell, however,\n&#39;, &#39;into good hands. The Italian had mentioned the name of the spot for\n&#39;, &#39;which they were bound, and after her death the woman of the house in\n&#39;, &#39;which they had lived took care that Safie should arrive in safety at\n&#39;, &#39;the cottage of her lover.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Chapter 15\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Such was the history of my beloved cottagers. It impressed me deeply.\n&#39;, &#39;I learned, from the views of social life which it developed, to admire\n&#39;, &#39;their virtues and to deprecate the vices of mankind.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“As yet I looked upon crime as a distant evil, benevolence and\n&#39;, &#39;generosity were ever present before me, inciting within me a desire to\n&#39;, &#39;become an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities\n&#39;, &#39;were called forth and displayed. But in giving an account of the\n&#39;, &#39;progress of my intellect, I must not omit a circumstance which occurred\n&#39;, &#39;in the beginning of the month of August of the same year.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“One night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where I\n&#39;, &#39;collected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors, I found on\n&#39;, &#39;the ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and\n&#39;, &#39;some books. I eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel. \n&#39;, &#39;Fortunately the books were written in the language, the elements of which I\n&#39;, &#39;had acquired at the cottage; they consisted of _Paradise Lost_, a volume\n&#39;, &#39;of _Plutarch’s Lives_, and the _Sorrows of Werter_. The\n&#39;, &#39;possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight; I now continually\n&#39;, &#39;studied and exercised my mind upon these histories, whilst my friends were\n&#39;, &#39;employed in their ordinary occupations.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I can hardly describe to you the effect of these books. They produced\n&#39;, &#39;in me an infinity of new images and feelings, that sometimes raised me\n&#39;, &#39;to ecstasy, but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection. In\n&#39;, &#39;the _Sorrows of Werter_, besides the interest of its simple and affecting\n&#39;, &#39;story, so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon\n&#39;, &#39;what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that I found in it a\n&#39;, &#39;never-ending source of speculation and astonishment. The gentle and\n&#39;, &#39;domestic manners it described, combined with lofty sentiments and\n&#39;, &#39;feelings, which had for their object something out of self, accorded\n&#39;, &#39;well with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which\n&#39;, &#39;were for ever alive in my own bosom. But I thought Werter himself a\n&#39;, &#39;more divine being than I had ever beheld or imagined; his character\n&#39;, &#39;contained no pretension, but it sank deep. The disquisitions upon\n&#39;, &#39;death and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder. I did not\n&#39;, &#39;pretend to enter into the merits of the case, yet I inclined towards\n&#39;, &#39;the opinions of the hero, whose extinction I wept, without precisely\n&#39;, &#39;understanding it.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“As I read, however, I applied much personally to my own feelings and\n&#39;, &#39;condition. I found myself similar yet at the same time strangely\n&#39;, &#39;unlike to the beings concerning whom I read and to whose conversation I\n&#39;, &#39;was a listener. I sympathised with and partly understood them, but I\n&#39;, &#39;was unformed in mind; I was dependent on none and related to none.\n&#39;, &#39;‘The path of my departure was free,’ and there was none to lament my\n&#39;, &#39;annihilation. My person was hideous and my stature gigantic. What did\n&#39;, &#39;this mean? Who was I? What was I? Whence did I come? What was my\n&#39;, &#39;destination? These questions continually recurred, but I was unable to\n&#39;, &#39;solve them.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“The volume of _Plutarch’s Lives_ which I possessed contained the\n&#39;, &#39;histories of the first founders of the ancient republics. This book\n&#39;, &#39;had a far different effect upon me from the _Sorrows of Werter_. I\n&#39;, &#39;learned from Werter’s imaginations despondency and gloom, but Plutarch\n&#39;, &#39;taught me high thoughts; he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my\n&#39;, &#39;own reflections, to admire and love the heroes of past ages. Many\n&#39;, &#39;things I read surpassed my understanding and experience. I had a very\n&#39;, &#39;confused knowledge of kingdoms, wide extents of country, mighty rivers,\n&#39;, &#39;and boundless seas. But I was perfectly unacquainted with towns and\n&#39;, &#39;large assemblages of men. The cottage of my protectors had been the\n&#39;, &#39;only school in which I had studied human nature, but this book\n&#39;, &#39;developed new and mightier scenes of action. I read of men concerned\n&#39;, &#39;in public affairs, governing or massacring their species. I felt the\n&#39;, &#39;greatest ardour for virtue rise within me, and abhorrence for vice, as\n&#39;, &#39;far as I understood the signification of those terms, relative as they\n&#39;, &#39;were, as I applied them, to pleasure and pain alone. Induced by these\n&#39;, &#39;feelings, I was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers, Numa,\n&#39;, &#39;Solon, and Lycurgus, in preference to Romulus and Theseus. The\n&#39;, &#39;patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a\n&#39;, &#39;firm hold on my mind; perhaps, if my first introduction to humanity had\n&#39;, &#39;been made by a young soldier, burning for glory and slaughter, I should\n&#39;, &#39;have been imbued with different sensations.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“But _Paradise Lost_ excited different and far deeper emotions. I read\n&#39;, &#39;it, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as\n&#39;, &#39;a true history. It moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the\n&#39;, &#39;picture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of\n&#39;, &#39;exciting. I often referred the several situations, as their similarity\n&#39;, &#39;struck me, to my own. Like Adam, I was apparently united by no link to\n&#39;, &#39;any other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine\n&#39;, &#39;in every other respect. He had come forth from the hands of God a\n&#39;, &#39;perfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of\n&#39;, &#39;his Creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from\n&#39;, &#39;beings of a superior nature, but I was wretched, helpless, and alone.\n&#39;, &#39;Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition, for\n&#39;, &#39;often, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter\n&#39;, &#39;gall of envy rose within me.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings. Soon\n&#39;, &#39;after my arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the pocket of\n&#39;, &#39;the dress which I had taken from your laboratory. At first I had\n&#39;, &#39;neglected them, but now that I was able to decipher the characters in\n&#39;, &#39;which they were written, I began to study them with diligence. It was\n&#39;, &#39;your journal of the four months that preceded my creation. You\n&#39;, &#39;minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress\n&#39;, &#39;of your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic\n&#39;, &#39;occurrences. You doubtless recollect these papers. Here they are.\n&#39;, &#39;Everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed\n&#39;, &#39;origin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances\n&#39;, &#39;which produced it is set in view; the minutest description of my odious\n&#39;, &#39;and loathsome person is given, in language which painted your own\n&#39;, &#39;horrors and rendered mine indelible. I sickened as I read. ‘Hateful\n&#39;, &#39;day when I received life!’ I exclaimed in agony. ‘Accursed creator!\n&#39;, &#39;Why did you form a monster so hideous that even _you_ turned from me in\n&#39;, &#39;disgust? God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own\n&#39;, &#39;image; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the\n&#39;, &#39;very resemblance. Satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admire\n&#39;, &#39;and encourage him, but I am solitary and abhorred.’\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“These were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude;\n&#39;, &#39;but when I contemplated the virtues of the cottagers, their amiable and\n&#39;, &#39;benevolent dispositions, I persuaded myself that when they should\n&#39;, &#39;become acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they would\n&#39;, &#39;compassionate me and overlook my personal deformity. Could they turn\n&#39;, &#39;from their door one, however monstrous, who solicited their compassion\n&#39;, &#39;and friendship? I resolved, at least, not to despair, but in every way\n&#39;, &#39;to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate. I\n&#39;, &#39;postponed this attempt for some months longer, for the importance\n&#39;, &#39;attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest I should fail.\n&#39;, &#39;Besides, I found that my understanding improved so much with every\n&#39;, &#39;day’s experience that I was unwilling to commence this undertaking\n&#39;, &#39;until a few more months should have added to my sagacity.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Several changes, in the meantime, took place in the cottage. The\n&#39;, &#39;presence of Safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants, and I also\n&#39;, &#39;found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there. Felix and Agatha\n&#39;, &#39;spent more time in amusement and conversation, and were assisted in\n&#39;, &#39;their labours by servants. They did not appear rich, but they were\n&#39;, &#39;contented and happy; their feelings were serene and peaceful, while\n&#39;, &#39;mine became every day more tumultuous. Increase of knowledge only\n&#39;, &#39;discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was. I\n&#39;, &#39;cherished hope, it is true, but it vanished when I beheld my person\n&#39;, &#39;reflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine, even as that frail\n&#39;, &#39;image and that inconstant shade.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial\n&#39;, &#39;which in a few months I resolved to undergo; and sometimes I allowed my\n&#39;, &#39;thoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, and\n&#39;, &#39;dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathising with my\n&#39;, &#39;feelings and cheering my gloom; their angelic countenances breathed\n&#39;, &#39;smiles of consolation. But it was all a dream; no Eve soothed my\n&#39;, &#39;sorrows nor shared my thoughts; I was alone. I remembered Adam’s\n&#39;, &#39;supplication to his Creator. But where was mine? He had abandoned me,\n&#39;, &#39;and in the bitterness of my heart I cursed him.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Autumn passed thus. I saw, with surprise and grief, the leaves decay\n&#39;, &#39;and fall, and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it\n&#39;, &#39;had worn when I first beheld the woods and the lovely moon. Yet I did\n&#39;, &#39;not heed the bleakness of the weather; I was better fitted by my\n&#39;, &#39;conformation for the endurance of cold than heat. But my chief\n&#39;, &#39;delights were the sight of the flowers, the birds, and all the gay\n&#39;, &#39;apparel of summer; when those deserted me, I turned with more attention\n&#39;, &#39;towards the cottagers. Their happiness was not decreased by the\n&#39;, &#39;absence of summer. They loved and sympathised with one another; and\n&#39;, &#39;their joys, depending on each other, were not interrupted by the\n&#39;, &#39;casualties that took place around them. The more I saw of them, the\n&#39;, &#39;greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness; my\n&#39;, &#39;heart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures; to see\n&#39;, &#39;their sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost\n&#39;, &#39;limit of my ambition. I dared not think that they would turn them from\n&#39;, &#39;me with disdain and horror. The poor that stopped at their door were\n&#39;, &#39;never driven away. I asked, it is true, for greater treasures than a\n&#39;, &#39;little food or rest: I required kindness and sympathy; but I did not\n&#39;, &#39;believe myself utterly unworthy of it.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“The winter advanced, and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken\n&#39;, &#39;place since I awoke into life. My attention at this time was solely\n&#39;, &#39;directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my\n&#39;, &#39;protectors. I revolved many projects, but that on which I finally\n&#39;, &#39;fixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone.\n&#39;, &#39;I had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my\n&#39;, &#39;person was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly\n&#39;, &#39;beheld me. My voice, although harsh, had nothing terrible in it; I\n&#39;, &#39;thought, therefore, that if in the absence of his children I could gain\n&#39;, &#39;the good will and mediation of the old De Lacey, I might by his means\n&#39;, &#39;be tolerated by my younger protectors.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“One day, when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground\n&#39;, &#39;and diffused cheerfulness, although it denied warmth, Safie, Agatha,\n&#39;, &#39;and Felix departed on a long country walk, and the old man, at his own\n&#39;, &#39;desire, was left alone in the cottage. When his children had departed,\n&#39;, &#39;he took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs, more\n&#39;, &#39;sweet and mournful than I had ever heard him play before. At first his\n&#39;, &#39;countenance was illuminated with pleasure, but as he continued,\n&#39;, &#39;thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded; at length, laying aside the\n&#39;, &#39;instrument, he sat absorbed in reflection.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“My heart beat quick; this was the hour and moment of trial, which\n&#39;, &#39;would decide my hopes or realise my fears. The servants were gone to a\n&#39;, &#39;neighbouring fair. All was silent in and around the cottage; it was an\n&#39;, &#39;excellent opportunity; yet, when I proceeded to execute my plan, my\n&#39;, &#39;limbs failed me and I sank to the ground. Again I rose, and exerting\n&#39;, &#39;all the firmness of which I was master, removed the planks which I had\n&#39;, &#39;placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat. The fresh air revived\n&#39;, &#39;me, and with renewed determination I approached the door of their\n&#39;, &#39;cottage.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I knocked. ‘Who is there?’ said the old man. ‘Come in.’\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I entered. ‘Pardon this intrusion,’ said I; ‘I am\n&#39;, &#39;a traveller in want of a little rest; you would greatly oblige me if you\n&#39;, &#39;would allow me to remain a few minutes before the fire.’\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“‘Enter,’ said De Lacey, ‘and I will try in what\n&#39;, &#39;manner I can to relieve your wants; but, unfortunately, my children are\n&#39;, &#39;from home, and as I am blind, I am afraid I shall find it difficult to\n&#39;, &#39;procure food for you.’\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“‘Do not trouble yourself, my kind host; I have food; it is\n&#39;, &#39;warmth and rest only that I need.’\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I sat down, and a silence ensued. I knew that every minute was\n&#39;, &#39;precious to me, yet I remained irresolute in what manner to commence\n&#39;, &#39;the interview, when the old man addressed me.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;‘By your language, stranger, I suppose you are my countryman; are you\n&#39;, &#39;French?’\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“‘No; but I was educated by a French family and understand that\n&#39;, &#39;language only. I am now going to claim the protection of some friends,\n&#39;, &#39;whom I sincerely love, and of whose favour I have some hopes.’\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“‘Are they Germans?’\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“‘No, they are French. But let us change the subject. I am an\n&#39;, &#39;unfortunate and deserted creature, I look around and I have no relation\n&#39;, &#39;or friend upon earth. These amiable people to whom I go have never\n&#39;, &#39;seen me and know little of me. I am full of fears, for if I fail\n&#39;, &#39;there, I am an outcast in the world for ever.’\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“‘Do not despair. To be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate, but\n&#39;, &#39;the hearts of men, when unprejudiced by any obvious self-interest, are\n&#39;, &#39;full of brotherly love and charity. Rely, therefore, on your hopes;\n&#39;, &#39;and if these friends are good and amiable, do not despair.’\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“‘They are kind—they are the most excellent creatures in the world;\n&#39;, &#39;but, unfortunately, they are prejudiced against me. I have good\n&#39;, &#39;dispositions; my life has been hitherto harmless and in some degree\n&#39;, &#39;beneficial; but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes, and where they\n&#39;, &#39;ought to see a feeling and kind friend, they behold only a detestable\n&#39;, &#39;monster.’\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“‘That is indeed unfortunate; but if you are really blameless, cannot\n&#39;, &#39;you undeceive them?’\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“‘I am about to undertake that task; and it is on that account that I\n&#39;, &#39;feel so many overwhelming terrors. I tenderly love these friends; I\n&#39;, &#39;have, unknown to them, been for many months in the habits of daily\n&#39;, &#39;kindness towards them; but they believe that I wish to injure them, and\n&#39;, &#39;it is that prejudice which I wish to overcome.’\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“‘Where do these friends reside?’\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“‘Near this spot.’\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“The old man paused and then continued, ‘If you will unreservedly\n&#39;, &#39;confide to me the particulars of your tale, I perhaps may be of use in\n&#39;, &#39;undeceiving them. I am blind and cannot judge of your countenance, but\n&#39;, &#39;there is something in your words which persuades me that you are\n&#39;, &#39;sincere. I am poor and an exile, but it will afford me true pleasure\n&#39;, &#39;to be in any way serviceable to a human creature.’\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“‘Excellent man! I thank you and accept your generous offer. You\n&#39;, &#39;raise me from the dust by this kindness; and I trust that, by your aid,\n&#39;, &#39;I shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow\n&#39;, &#39;creatures.’\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“‘Heaven forbid! Even if you were really criminal, for that can only\n&#39;, &#39;drive you to desperation, and not instigate you to virtue. I also am\n&#39;, &#39;unfortunate; I and my family have been condemned, although innocent;\n&#39;, &#39;judge, therefore, if I do not feel for your misfortunes.’\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“‘How can I thank you, my best and only benefactor? From your lips\n&#39;, &#39;first have I heard the voice of kindness directed towards me; I shall\n&#39;, &#39;be for ever grateful; and your present humanity assures me of success\n&#39;, &#39;with those friends whom I am on the point of meeting.’\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“‘May I know the names and residence of those friends?’\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I paused. This, I thought, was the moment of decision, which was to\n&#39;, &#39;rob me of or bestow happiness on me for ever. I struggled vainly for\n&#39;, &#39;firmness sufficient to answer him, but the effort destroyed all my\n&#39;, &#39;remaining strength; I sank on the chair and sobbed aloud. At that\n&#39;, &#39;moment I heard the steps of my younger protectors. I had not a moment\n&#39;, &#39;to lose, but seizing the hand of the old man, I cried, ‘Now is the\n&#39;, &#39;time! Save and protect me! You and your family are the friends whom I\n&#39;, &#39;seek. Do not you desert me in the hour of trial!’\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“‘Great God!’ exclaimed the old man. ‘Who are you?’\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“At that instant the cottage door was opened, and Felix, Safie, and\n&#39;, &#39;Agatha entered. Who can describe their horror and consternation on\n&#39;, &#39;beholding me? Agatha fainted, and Safie, unable to attend to her\n&#39;, &#39;friend, rushed out of the cottage. Felix darted forward, and with\n&#39;, &#39;supernatural force tore me from his father, to whose knees I clung, in\n&#39;, &#39;a transport of fury, he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently\n&#39;, &#39;with a stick. I could have torn him limb from limb, as the lion rends\n&#39;, &#39;the antelope. But my heart sank within me as with bitter sickness, and\n&#39;, &#39;I refrained. I saw him on the point of repeating his blow, when,\n&#39;, &#39;overcome by pain and anguish, I quitted the cottage, and in the general\n&#39;, &#39;tumult escaped unperceived to my hovel.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Chapter 16\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Cursed, cursed creator! Why did I live? Why, in that instant, did I\n&#39;, &#39;not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly\n&#39;, &#39;bestowed? I know not; despair had not yet taken possession of me; my\n&#39;, &#39;feelings were those of rage and revenge. I could with pleasure have\n&#39;, &#39;destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with\n&#39;, &#39;their shrieks and misery.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“When night came I quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood; and\n&#39;, &#39;now, no longer restrained by the fear of discovery, I gave vent to my\n&#39;, &#39;anguish in fearful howlings. I was like a wild beast that had broken\n&#39;, &#39;the toils, destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging\n&#39;, &#39;through the wood with a stag-like swiftness. Oh! What a miserable\n&#39;, &#39;night I passed! The cold stars shone in mockery, and the bare trees\n&#39;, &#39;waved their branches above me; now and then the sweet voice of a bird\n&#39;, &#39;burst forth amidst the universal stillness. All, save I, were at rest\n&#39;, &#39;or in enjoyment; I, like the arch-fiend, bore a hell within me, and\n&#39;, &#39;finding myself unsympathised with, wished to tear up the trees, spread\n&#39;, &#39;havoc and destruction around me, and then to have sat down and enjoyed\n&#39;, &#39;the ruin.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“But this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure; I became\n&#39;, &#39;fatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in\n&#39;, &#39;the sick impotence of despair. There was none among the myriads of men\n&#39;, &#39;that existed who would pity or assist me; and should I feel kindness\n&#39;, &#39;towards my enemies? No; from that moment I declared everlasting war\n&#39;, &#39;against the species, and more than all, against him who had formed me\n&#39;, &#39;and sent me forth to this insupportable misery.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“The sun rose; I heard the voices of men and knew that it was\n&#39;, &#39;impossible to return to my retreat during that day. Accordingly I hid\n&#39;, &#39;myself in some thick underwood, determining to devote the ensuing hours\n&#39;, &#39;to reflection on my situation.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“The pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some\n&#39;, &#39;degree of tranquillity; and when I considered what had passed at the\n&#39;, &#39;cottage, I could not help believing that I had been too hasty in my\n&#39;, &#39;conclusions. I had certainly acted imprudently. It was apparent that\n&#39;, &#39;my conversation had interested the father in my behalf, and I was a\n&#39;, &#39;fool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children. I\n&#39;, &#39;ought to have familiarised the old De Lacey to me, and by degrees to\n&#39;, &#39;have discovered myself to the rest of his family, when they should have\n&#39;, &#39;been prepared for my approach. But I did not believe my errors to be\n&#39;, &#39;irretrievable, and after much consideration I resolved to return to the\n&#39;, &#39;cottage, seek the old man, and by my representations win him to my\n&#39;, &#39;party.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“These thoughts calmed me, and in the afternoon I sank into a profound\n&#39;, &#39;sleep; but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by\n&#39;, &#39;peaceful dreams. The horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever\n&#39;, &#39;acting before my eyes; the females were flying and the enraged Felix\n&#39;, &#39;tearing me from his father’s feet. I awoke exhausted, and finding that\n&#39;, &#39;it was already night, I crept forth from my hiding-place, and went in\n&#39;, &#39;search of food.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“When my hunger was appeased, I directed my steps towards the\n&#39;, &#39;well-known path that conducted to the cottage. All there was at peace.\n&#39;, &#39;I crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the\n&#39;, &#39;accustomed hour when the family arose. That hour passed, the sun\n&#39;, &#39;mounted high in the heavens, but the cottagers did not appear. I\n&#39;, &#39;trembled violently, apprehending some dreadful misfortune. The inside\n&#39;, &#39;of the cottage was dark, and I heard no motion; I cannot describe the\n&#39;, &#39;agony of this suspense.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Presently two countrymen passed by, but pausing near the cottage, they\n&#39;, &#39;entered into conversation, using violent gesticulations; but I did not\n&#39;, &#39;understand what they said, as they spoke the language of the country,\n&#39;, &#39;which differed from that of my protectors. Soon after, however, Felix\n&#39;, &#39;approached with another man; I was surprised, as I knew that he had not\n&#39;, &#39;quitted the cottage that morning, and waited anxiously to discover from\n&#39;, &#39;his discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“‘Do you consider,’ said his companion to him,\n&#39;, &#39;‘that you will be obliged to pay three months’ rent and to lose\n&#39;, &#39;the produce of your garden? I do not wish to take any unfair advantage, and\n&#39;, &#39;I beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your\n&#39;, &#39;determination.’\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“‘It is utterly useless,’ replied Felix; ‘we can\n&#39;, &#39;never again inhabit your cottage. The life of my father is in the greatest\n&#39;, &#39;danger, owing to the dreadful circumstance that I have related. My wife and\n&#39;, &#39;my sister will never recover from their horror. I entreat you not to reason\n&#39;, &#39;with me any more. Take possession of your tenement and let me fly from this\n&#39;, &#39;place.’\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Felix trembled violently as he said this. He and his companion\n&#39;, &#39;entered the cottage, in which they remained for a few minutes, and then\n&#39;, &#39;departed. I never saw any of the family of De Lacey more.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of\n&#39;, &#39;utter and stupid despair. My protectors had departed and had broken\n&#39;, &#39;the only link that held me to the world. For the first time the\n&#39;, &#39;feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom, and I did not strive to\n&#39;, &#39;control them, but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream, I\n&#39;, &#39;bent my mind towards injury and death. When I thought of my friends,\n&#39;, &#39;of the mild voice of De Lacey, the gentle eyes of Agatha, and the\n&#39;, &#39;exquisite beauty of the Arabian, these thoughts vanished and a gush of\n&#39;, &#39;tears somewhat soothed me. But again when I reflected that they had\n&#39;, &#39;spurned and deserted me, anger returned, a rage of anger, and unable to\n&#39;, &#39;injure anything human, I turned my fury towards inanimate objects. As\n&#39;, &#39;night advanced, I placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage,\n&#39;, &#39;and after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden,\n&#39;, &#39;I waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my\n&#39;, &#39;operations.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“As the night advanced, a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly\n&#39;, &#39;dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens; the blast tore\n&#39;, &#39;along like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my\n&#39;, &#39;spirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection. I lighted the\n&#39;, &#39;dry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage,\n&#39;, &#39;my eyes still fixed on the western horizon, the edge of which the moon\n&#39;, &#39;nearly touched. A part of its orb was at length hid, and I waved my\n&#39;, &#39;brand; it sank, and with a loud scream I fired the straw, and heath,\n&#39;, &#39;and bushes, which I had collected. The wind fanned the fire, and the\n&#39;, &#39;cottage was quickly enveloped by the flames, which clung to it and\n&#39;, &#39;licked it with their forked and destroying tongues.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“As soon as I was convinced that no assistance could save any part of\n&#39;, &#39;the habitation, I quitted the scene and sought for refuge in the woods.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“And now, with the world before me, whither should I bend my steps? I\n&#39;, &#39;resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes; but to me, hated\n&#39;, &#39;and despised, every country must be equally horrible. At length the\n&#39;, &#39;thought of you crossed my mind. I learned from your papers that you\n&#39;, &#39;were my father, my creator; and to whom could I apply with more fitness\n&#39;, &#39;than to him who had given me life? Among the lessons that Felix had\n&#39;, &#39;bestowed upon Safie, geography had not been omitted; I had learned from\n&#39;, &#39;these the relative situations of the different countries of the earth.\n&#39;, &#39;You had mentioned Geneva as the name of your native town, and towards\n&#39;, &#39;this place I resolved to proceed.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“But how was I to direct myself? I knew that I must travel in a\n&#39;, &#39;southwesterly direction to reach my destination, but the sun was my\n&#39;, &#39;only guide. I did not know the names of the towns that I was to pass\n&#39;, &#39;through, nor could I ask information from a single human being; but I\n&#39;, &#39;did not despair. From you only could I hope for succour, although\n&#39;, &#39;towards you I felt no sentiment but that of hatred. Unfeeling,\n&#39;, &#39;heartless creator! You had endowed me with perceptions and passions\n&#39;, &#39;and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind.\n&#39;, &#39;But on you only had I any claim for pity and redress, and from you I\n&#39;, &#39;determined to seek that justice which I vainly attempted to gain from\n&#39;, &#39;any other being that wore the human form.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“My travels were long and the sufferings I endured intense. It was\n&#39;, &#39;late in autumn when I quitted the district where I had so long resided.\n&#39;, &#39;I travelled only at night, fearful of encountering the visage of a\n&#39;, &#39;human being. Nature decayed around me, and the sun became heatless;\n&#39;, &#39;rain and snow poured around me; mighty rivers were frozen; the surface\n&#39;, &#39;of the earth was hard and chill, and bare, and I found no shelter. Oh,\n&#39;, &#39;earth! How often did I imprecate curses on the cause of my being! The\n&#39;, &#39;mildness of my nature had fled, and all within me was turned to gall\n&#39;, &#39;and bitterness. The nearer I approached to your habitation, the more\n&#39;, &#39;deeply did I feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart. Snow\n&#39;, &#39;fell, and the waters were hardened, but I rested not. A few incidents\n&#39;, &#39;now and then directed me, and I possessed a map of the country; but I\n&#39;, &#39;often wandered wide from my path. The agony of my feelings allowed me\n&#39;, &#39;no respite; no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could\n&#39;, &#39;not extract its food; but a circumstance that happened when I arrived\n&#39;, &#39;on the confines of Switzerland, when the sun had recovered its warmth\n&#39;, &#39;and the earth again began to look green, confirmed in an especial\n&#39;, &#39;manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I generally rested during the day and travelled only when I was\n&#39;, &#39;secured by night from the view of man. One morning, however, finding\n&#39;, &#39;that my path lay through a deep wood, I ventured to continue my journey\n&#39;, &#39;after the sun had risen; the day, which was one of the first of spring,\n&#39;, &#39;cheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of\n&#39;, &#39;the air. I felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure, that had long\n&#39;, &#39;appeared dead, revive within me. Half surprised by the novelty of\n&#39;, &#39;these sensations, I allowed myself to be borne away by them, and\n&#39;, &#39;forgetting my solitude and deformity, dared to be happy. Soft tears\n&#39;, &#39;again bedewed my cheeks, and I even raised my humid eyes with\n&#39;, &#39;thankfulness towards the blessed sun, which bestowed such joy upon me.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I continued to wind among the paths of the wood, until I came to its\n&#39;, &#39;boundary, which was skirted by a deep and rapid river, into which many\n&#39;, &#39;of the trees bent their branches, now budding with the fresh spring.\n&#39;, &#39;Here I paused, not exactly knowing what path to pursue, when I heard\n&#39;, &#39;the sound of voices, that induced me to conceal myself under the shade\n&#39;, &#39;of a cypress. I was scarcely hid when a young girl came running\n&#39;, &#39;towards the spot where I was concealed, laughing, as if she ran from\n&#39;, &#39;someone in sport. She continued her course along the precipitous sides\n&#39;, &#39;of the river, when suddenly her foot slipped, and she fell into the\n&#39;, &#39;rapid stream. I rushed from my hiding-place and with extreme labour,\n&#39;, &#39;from the force of the current, saved her and dragged her to shore. She\n&#39;, &#39;was senseless, and I endeavoured by every means in my power to restore\n&#39;, &#39;animation, when I was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic,\n&#39;, &#39;who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled. On\n&#39;, &#39;seeing me, he darted towards me, and tearing the girl from my arms,\n&#39;, &#39;hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood. I followed speedily, I\n&#39;, &#39;hardly knew why; but when the man saw me draw near, he aimed a gun,\n&#39;, &#39;which he carried, at my body and fired. I sank to the ground, and my\n&#39;, &#39;injurer, with increased swiftness, escaped into the wood.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“This was then the reward of my benevolence! I had saved a human being\n&#39;, &#39;from destruction, and as a recompense I now writhed under the miserable\n&#39;, &#39;pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone. The feelings of\n&#39;, &#39;kindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments\n&#39;, &#39;before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth. Inflamed by\n&#39;, &#39;pain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind. But the\n&#39;, &#39;agony of my wound overcame me; my pulses paused, and I fainted.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“For some weeks I led a miserable life in the woods, endeavouring to\n&#39;, &#39;cure the wound which I had received. The ball had entered my shoulder,\n&#39;, &#39;and I knew not whether it had remained there or passed through; at any\n&#39;, &#39;rate I had no means of extracting it. My sufferings were augmented\n&#39;, &#39;also by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their\n&#39;, &#39;infliction. My daily vows rose for revenge—a deep and deadly revenge,\n&#39;, &#39;such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish I had\n&#39;, &#39;endured.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“After some weeks my wound healed, and I continued my journey. The\n&#39;, &#39;labours I endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or\n&#39;, &#39;gentle breezes of spring; all joy was but a mockery which insulted my\n&#39;, &#39;desolate state and made me feel more painfully that I was not made for\n&#39;, &#39;the enjoyment of pleasure.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“But my toils now drew near a close, and in two months from this time I\n&#39;, &#39;reached the environs of Geneva.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“It was evening when I arrived, and I retired to a hiding-place among\n&#39;, &#39;the fields that surround it to meditate in what manner I should apply\n&#39;, &#39;to you. I was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to\n&#39;, &#39;enjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting\n&#39;, &#39;behind the stupendous mountains of Jura.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“At this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection,\n&#39;, &#39;which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child, who came\n&#39;, &#39;running into the recess I had chosen, with all the sportiveness of\n&#39;, &#39;infancy. Suddenly, as I gazed on him, an idea seized me that this\n&#39;, &#39;little creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have\n&#39;, &#39;imbibed a horror of deformity. If, therefore, I could seize him and\n&#39;, &#39;educate him as my companion and friend, I should not be so desolate in\n&#39;, &#39;this peopled earth.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Urged by this impulse, I seized on the boy as he passed and drew him\n&#39;, &#39;towards me. As soon as he beheld my form, he placed his hands before\n&#39;, &#39;his eyes and uttered a shrill scream; I drew his hand forcibly from his\n&#39;, &#39;face and said, ‘Child, what is the meaning of this? I do not intend to\n&#39;, &#39;hurt you; listen to me.’\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“He struggled violently. ‘Let me go,’ he cried;\n&#39;, &#39;‘monster! Ugly wretch! You wish to eat me and tear me to pieces. You\n&#39;, &#39;are an ogre. Let me go, or I will tell my papa.’\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“‘Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.’\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“‘Hideous monster! Let me go. My papa is a syndic—he is M.\n&#39;, &#39;Frankenstein—he will punish you. You dare not keep me.’\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“‘Frankenstein! you belong then to my enemy—to him towards whom I have\n&#39;, &#39;sworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.’\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“The child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried\n&#39;, &#39;despair to my heart; I grasped his throat to silence him, and in a\n&#39;, &#39;moment he lay dead at my feet.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I gazed on my victim, and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish\n&#39;, &#39;triumph; clapping my hands, I exclaimed, ‘I too can create desolation;\n&#39;, &#39;my enemy is not invulnerable; this death will carry despair to him, and\n&#39;, &#39;a thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him.’\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“As I fixed my eyes on the child, I saw something glittering on his\n&#39;, &#39;breast. I took it; it was a portrait of a most lovely woman. In spite\n&#39;, &#39;of my malignity, it softened and attracted me. For a few moments I\n&#39;, &#39;gazed with delight on her dark eyes, fringed by deep lashes, and her\n&#39;, &#39;lovely lips; but presently my rage returned; I remembered that I was\n&#39;, &#39;for ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could\n&#39;, &#39;bestow and that she whose resemblance I contemplated would, in\n&#39;, &#39;regarding me, have changed that air of divine benignity to one\n&#39;, &#39;expressive of disgust and affright.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage? I only\n&#39;, &#39;wonder that at that moment, instead of venting my sensations in\n&#39;, &#39;exclamations and agony, I did not rush among mankind and perish in the\n&#39;, &#39;attempt to destroy them.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“While I was overcome by these feelings, I left the spot where I had\n&#39;, &#39;committed the murder, and seeking a more secluded hiding-place, I\n&#39;, &#39;entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty. A woman was\n&#39;, &#39;sleeping on some straw; she was young, not indeed so beautiful as her\n&#39;, &#39;whose portrait I held, but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the\n&#39;, &#39;loveliness of youth and health. Here, I thought, is one of those whose\n&#39;, &#39;joy-imparting smiles are bestowed on all but me. And then I bent over\n&#39;, &#39;her and whispered, ‘Awake, fairest, thy lover is near—he who would\n&#39;, &#39;give his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes; my\n&#39;, &#39;beloved, awake!’\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“The sleeper stirred; a thrill of terror ran through me. Should she\n&#39;, &#39;indeed awake, and see me, and curse me, and denounce the murderer? Thus\n&#39;, &#39;would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me.\n&#39;, &#39;The thought was madness; it stirred the fiend within me—not I, but\n&#39;, &#39;she, shall suffer; the murder I have committed because I am for ever\n&#39;, &#39;robbed of all that she could give me, she shall atone. The crime had\n&#39;, &#39;its source in her; be hers the punishment! Thanks to the lessons of\n&#39;, &#39;Felix and the sanguinary laws of man, I had learned now to work\n&#39;, &#39;mischief. I bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of\n&#39;, &#39;the folds of her dress. She moved again, and I fled.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“For some days I haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place,\n&#39;, &#39;sometimes wishing to see you, sometimes resolved to quit the world and\n&#39;, &#39;its miseries for ever. At length I wandered towards these mountains,\n&#39;, &#39;and have ranged through their immense recesses, consumed by a burning\n&#39;, &#39;passion which you alone can gratify. We may not part until you have\n&#39;, &#39;promised to comply with my requisition. I am alone and miserable; man\n&#39;, &#39;will not associate with me; but one as deformed and horrible as myself\n&#39;, &#39;would not deny herself to me. My companion must be of the same species\n&#39;, &#39;and have the same defects. This being you must create.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Chapter 17\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;The being finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me in the\n&#39;, &#39;expectation of a reply. But I was bewildered, perplexed, and unable to\n&#39;, &#39;arrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his\n&#39;, &#39;proposition. He continued,\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“You must create a female for me with whom I can live in the\n&#39;, &#39;interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being. This you alone\n&#39;, &#39;can do, and I demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to\n&#39;, &#39;concede.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;The latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had\n&#39;, &#39;died away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers, and\n&#39;, &#39;as he said this I could no longer suppress the rage that burned within\n&#39;, &#39;me.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I do refuse it,” I replied; “and no torture shall ever extort a\n&#39;, &#39;consent from me. You may render me the most miserable of men, but you\n&#39;, &#39;shall never make me base in my own eyes. Shall I create another like\n&#39;, &#39;yourself, whose joint wickedness might desolate the world. Begone! I\n&#39;, &#39;have answered you; you may torture me, but I will never consent.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“You are in the wrong,” replied the fiend; “and instead\n&#39;, &#39;of threatening, I am content to reason with you. I am malicious because I\n&#39;, &#39;am miserable. Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind? You, my creator,\n&#39;, &#39;would tear me to pieces and triumph; remember that, and tell me why I\n&#39;, &#39;should pity man more than he pities me? You would not call it murder if you\n&#39;, &#39;could precipitate me into one of those ice-rifts and destroy my frame, the\n&#39;, &#39;work of your own hands. Shall I respect man when he condemns me? Let him\n&#39;, &#39;live with me in the interchange of kindness, and instead of injury I would\n&#39;, &#39;bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance.\n&#39;, &#39;But that cannot be; the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our\n&#39;, &#39;union. Yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery. I will\n&#39;, &#39;revenge my injuries; if I cannot inspire love, I will cause fear, and\n&#39;, &#39;chiefly towards you my arch-enemy, because my creator, do I swear\n&#39;, &#39;inextinguishable hatred. Have a care; I will work at your destruction, nor\n&#39;, &#39;finish until I desolate your heart, so that you shall curse the hour of\n&#39;, &#39;your birth.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;A fiendish rage animated him as he said this; his face was wrinkled\n&#39;, &#39;into contortions too horrible for human eyes to behold; but presently\n&#39;, &#39;he calmed himself and proceeded—\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I intended to reason. This passion is detrimental to me, for you do\n&#39;, &#39;not reflect that _you_ are the cause of its excess. If any being felt\n&#39;, &#39;emotions of benevolence towards me, I should return them a hundred and a\n&#39;, &#39;hundredfold; for that one creature’s sake I would make peace with the\n&#39;, &#39;whole kind! But I now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realised.\n&#39;, &#39;What I ask of you is reasonable and moderate; I demand a creature of\n&#39;, &#39;another sex, but as hideous as myself; the gratification is small, but it\n&#39;, &#39;is all that I can receive, and it shall content me. It is true, we shall be\n&#39;, &#39;monsters, cut off from all the world; but on that account we shall be more\n&#39;, &#39;attached to one another. Our lives will not be happy, but they will be\n&#39;, &#39;harmless and free from the misery I now feel. Oh! My creator, make me\n&#39;, &#39;happy; let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit! Let me see that I\n&#39;, &#39;excite the sympathy of some existing thing; do not deny me my\n&#39;, &#39;request!”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I was moved. I shuddered when I thought of the possible consequences\n&#39;, &#39;of my consent, but I felt that there was some justice in his argument.\n&#39;, &#39;His tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature\n&#39;, &#39;of fine sensations, and did I not as his maker owe him all the portion\n&#39;, &#39;of happiness that it was in my power to bestow? He saw my change of\n&#39;, &#39;feeling and continued,\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“If you consent, neither you nor any other human being shall ever see\n&#39;, &#39;us again; I will go to the vast wilds of South America. My food is not\n&#39;, &#39;that of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite;\n&#39;, &#39;acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment. My companion will\n&#39;, &#39;be of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare.\n&#39;, &#39;We shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on\n&#39;, &#39;man and will ripen our food. The picture I present to you is peaceful\n&#39;, &#39;and human, and you must feel that you could deny it only in the\n&#39;, &#39;wantonness of power and cruelty. Pitiless as you have been towards me,\n&#39;, &#39;I now see compassion in your eyes; let me seize the favourable moment\n&#39;, &#39;and persuade you to promise what I so ardently desire.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“You propose,” replied I, “to fly from the habitations of\n&#39;, &#39;man, to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your\n&#39;, &#39;only companions. How can you, who long for the love and sympathy of man,\n&#39;, &#39;persevere in this exile? You will return and again seek their kindness, and\n&#39;, &#39;you will meet with their detestation; your evil passions will be renewed,\n&#39;, &#39;and you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction.\n&#39;, &#39;This may not be; cease to argue the point, for I cannot consent.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“How inconstant are your feelings! But a moment ago you were moved by\n&#39;, &#39;my representations, and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints?\n&#39;, &#39;I swear to you, by the earth which I inhabit, and by you that made me, that\n&#39;, &#39;with the companion you bestow, I will quit the neighbourhood of man and\n&#39;, &#39;dwell, as it may chance, in the most savage of places. My evil passions\n&#39;, &#39;will have fled, for I shall meet with sympathy! My life will flow quietly\n&#39;, &#39;away, and in my dying moments I shall not curse my maker.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;His words had a strange effect upon me. I compassionated him and\n&#39;, &#39;sometimes felt a wish to console him, but when I looked upon him, when\n&#39;, &#39;I saw the filthy mass that moved and talked, my heart sickened and my\n&#39;, &#39;feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred. I tried to stifle\n&#39;, &#39;these sensations; I thought that as I could not sympathise with him, I\n&#39;, &#39;had no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which\n&#39;, &#39;was yet in my power to bestow.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“You swear,” I said, “to be harmless; but have you not\n&#39;, &#39;already shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust\n&#39;, &#39;you? May not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by\n&#39;, &#39;affording a wider scope for your revenge?”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“How is this? I must not be trifled with, and I demand an answer. If\n&#39;, &#39;I have no ties and no affections, hatred and vice must be my portion;\n&#39;, &#39;the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes, and I shall\n&#39;, &#39;become a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant. My vices\n&#39;, &#39;are the children of a forced solitude that I abhor, and my virtues will\n&#39;, &#39;necessarily arise when I live in communion with an equal. I shall feel\n&#39;, &#39;the affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of\n&#39;, &#39;existence and events from which I am now excluded.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various\n&#39;, &#39;arguments which he had employed. I thought of the promise of virtues which\n&#39;, &#39;he had displayed on the opening of his existence and the subsequent blight\n&#39;, &#39;of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had\n&#39;, &#39;manifested towards him. His power and threats were not omitted in my\n&#39;, &#39;calculations; a creature who could exist in the ice-caves of the glaciers\n&#39;, &#39;and hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices\n&#39;, &#39;was a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with. After a\n&#39;, &#39;long pause of reflection I concluded that the justice due both to him and\n&#39;, &#39;my fellow creatures demanded of me that I should comply with his request.\n&#39;, &#39;Turning to him, therefore, I said,\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I consent to your demand, on your solemn oath to quit Europe for ever,\n&#39;, &#39;and every other place in the neighbourhood of man, as soon as I shall\n&#39;, &#39;deliver into your hands a female who will accompany you in your exile.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I swear,” he cried, “by the sun, and by the blue sky of\n&#39;, &#39;heaven, and by the fire of love that burns my heart, that if you grant my\n&#39;, &#39;prayer, while they exist you shall never behold me again. Depart to your\n&#39;, &#39;home and commence your labours; I shall watch their progress with\n&#39;, &#39;unutterable anxiety; and fear not but that when you are ready I shall\n&#39;, &#39;appear.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Saying this, he suddenly quitted me, fearful, perhaps, of any change in\n&#39;, &#39;my sentiments. I saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than\n&#39;, &#39;the flight of an eagle, and quickly lost among the undulations of the\n&#39;, &#39;sea of ice.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;His tale had occupied the whole day, and the sun was upon the verge of\n&#39;, &#39;the horizon when he departed. I knew that I ought to hasten my descent\n&#39;, &#39;towards the valley, as I should soon be encompassed in darkness; but my\n&#39;, &#39;heart was heavy, and my steps slow. The labour of winding among the\n&#39;, &#39;little paths of the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as I advanced\n&#39;, &#39;perplexed me, occupied as I was by the emotions which the occurrences\n&#39;, &#39;of the day had produced. Night was far advanced when I came to the\n&#39;, &#39;halfway resting-place and seated myself beside the fountain. The stars\n&#39;, &#39;shone at intervals as the clouds passed from over them; the dark pines\n&#39;, &#39;rose before me, and every here and there a broken tree lay on the\n&#39;, &#39;ground; it was a scene of wonderful solemnity and stirred strange\n&#39;, &#39;thoughts within me. I wept bitterly, and clasping my hands in agony, I\n&#39;, &#39;exclaimed, “Oh! stars and clouds and winds, ye are all about to mock\n&#39;, &#39;me; if ye really pity me, crush sensation and memory; let me become as\n&#39;, &#39;nought; but if not, depart, depart, and leave me in darkness.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;These were wild and miserable thoughts, but I cannot describe to you\n&#39;, &#39;how the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and how I\n&#39;, &#39;listened to every blast of wind as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its\n&#39;, &#39;way to consume me.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Morning dawned before I arrived at the village of Chamounix; I took no\n&#39;, &#39;rest, but returned immediately to Geneva. Even in my own heart I could\n&#39;, &#39;give no expression to my sensations—they weighed on me with a\n&#39;, &#39;mountain’s weight and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them.\n&#39;, &#39;Thus I returned home, and entering the house, presented myself to the\n&#39;, &#39;family. My haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm, but I\n&#39;, &#39;answered no question, scarcely did I speak. I felt as if I were placed\n&#39;, &#39;under a ban—as if I had no right to claim their sympathies—as if\n&#39;, &#39;never more might I enjoy companionship with them. Yet even thus I\n&#39;, &#39;loved them to adoration; and to save them, I resolved to dedicate\n&#39;, &#39;myself to my most abhorred task. The prospect of such an occupation\n&#39;, &#39;made every other circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream,\n&#39;, &#39;and that thought only had to me the reality of life.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Chapter 18\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Day after day, week after week, passed away on my return to Geneva; and\n&#39;, &#39;I could not collect the courage to recommence my work. I feared the\n&#39;, &#39;vengeance of the disappointed fiend, yet I was unable to overcome my\n&#39;, &#39;repugnance to the task which was enjoined me. I found that I could not\n&#39;, &#39;compose a female without again devoting several months to profound\n&#39;, &#39;study and laborious disquisition. I had heard of some discoveries\n&#39;, &#39;having been made by an English philosopher, the knowledge of which was\n&#39;, &#39;material to my success, and I sometimes thought of obtaining my\n&#39;, &#39;father’s consent to visit England for this purpose; but I clung to\n&#39;, &#39;every pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an\n&#39;, &#39;undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to\n&#39;, &#39;me. A change indeed had taken place in me; my health, which had\n&#39;, &#39;hitherto declined, was now much restored; and my spirits, when\n&#39;, &#39;unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise, rose proportionably. My\n&#39;, &#39;father saw this change with pleasure, and he turned his thoughts\n&#39;, &#39;towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy,\n&#39;, &#39;which every now and then would return by fits, and with a devouring\n&#39;, &#39;blackness overcast the approaching sunshine. At these moments I took\n&#39;, &#39;refuge in the most perfect solitude. I passed whole days on the lake\n&#39;, &#39;alone in a little boat, watching the clouds and listening to the\n&#39;, &#39;rippling of the waves, silent and listless. But the fresh air and\n&#39;, &#39;bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure, and\n&#39;, &#39;on my return I met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile\n&#39;, &#39;and a more cheerful heart.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;It was after my return from one of these rambles that my father,\n&#39;, &#39;calling me aside, thus addressed me,\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I am happy to remark, my dear son, that you have resumed your former\n&#39;, &#39;pleasures and seem to be returning to yourself. And yet you are still\n&#39;, &#39;unhappy and still avoid our society. For some time I was lost in\n&#39;, &#39;conjecture as to the cause of this, but yesterday an idea struck me,\n&#39;, &#39;and if it is well founded, I conjure you to avow it. Reserve on such a\n&#39;, &#39;point would be not only useless, but draw down treble misery on us all.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I trembled violently at his exordium, and my father continued—\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I confess, my son, that I have always looked forward to your\n&#39;, &#39;marriage with our dear Elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and the\n&#39;, &#39;stay of my declining years. You were attached to each other from your\n&#39;, &#39;earliest infancy; you studied together, and appeared, in dispositions and\n&#39;, &#39;tastes, entirely suited to one another. But so blind is the experience of\n&#39;, &#39;man that what I conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have\n&#39;, &#39;entirely destroyed it. You, perhaps, regard her as your sister, without any\n&#39;, &#39;wish that she might become your wife. Nay, you may have met with another\n&#39;, &#39;whom you may love; and considering yourself as bound in honour to\n&#39;, &#39;Elizabeth, this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear\n&#39;, &#39;to feel.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“My dear father, reassure yourself. I love my cousin tenderly and\n&#39;, &#39;sincerely. I never saw any woman who excited, as Elizabeth does, my\n&#39;, &#39;warmest admiration and affection. My future hopes and prospects are\n&#39;, &#39;entirely bound up in the expectation of our union.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“The expression of your sentiments of this subject, my dear Victor,\n&#39;, &#39;gives me more pleasure than I have for some time experienced. If you\n&#39;, &#39;feel thus, we shall assuredly be happy, however present events may cast\n&#39;, &#39;a gloom over us. But it is this gloom which appears to have taken so\n&#39;, &#39;strong a hold of your mind that I wish to dissipate. Tell me,\n&#39;, &#39;therefore, whether you object to an immediate solemnisation of the\n&#39;, &#39;marriage. We have been unfortunate, and recent events have drawn us\n&#39;, &#39;from that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities. You\n&#39;, &#39;are younger; yet I do not suppose, possessed as you are of a competent\n&#39;, &#39;fortune, that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future\n&#39;, &#39;plans of honour and utility that you may have formed. Do not suppose,\n&#39;, &#39;however, that I wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on\n&#39;, &#39;your part would cause me any serious uneasiness. Interpret my words\n&#39;, &#39;with candour and answer me, I conjure you, with confidence and\n&#39;, &#39;sincerity.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable\n&#39;, &#39;of offering any reply. I revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of\n&#39;, &#39;thoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion. Alas! To me\n&#39;, &#39;the idea of an immediate union with my Elizabeth was one of horror and\n&#39;, &#39;dismay. I was bound by a solemn promise which I had not yet fulfilled\n&#39;, &#39;and dared not break, or if I did, what manifold miseries might not\n&#39;, &#39;impend over me and my devoted family! Could I enter into a festival\n&#39;, &#39;with this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to the\n&#39;, &#39;ground? I must perform my engagement and let the monster depart with\n&#39;, &#39;his mate before I allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union from\n&#39;, &#39;which I expected peace.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to\n&#39;, &#39;England or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers\n&#39;, &#39;of that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable\n&#39;, &#39;use to me in my present undertaking. The latter method of obtaining\n&#39;, &#39;the desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory; besides, I\n&#39;, &#39;had an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my\n&#39;, &#39;loathsome task in my father’s house while in habits of familiar\n&#39;, &#39;intercourse with those I loved. I knew that a thousand fearful\n&#39;, &#39;accidents might occur, the slightest of which would disclose a tale to\n&#39;, &#39;thrill all connected with me with horror. I was aware also that I\n&#39;, &#39;should often lose all self-command, all capacity of hiding the\n&#39;, &#39;harrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of my\n&#39;, &#39;unearthly occupation. I must absent myself from all I loved while thus\n&#39;, &#39;employed. Once commenced, it would quickly be achieved, and I might be\n&#39;, &#39;restored to my family in peace and happiness. My promise fulfilled,\n&#39;, &#39;the monster would depart for ever. Or (so my fond fancy imaged) some\n&#39;, &#39;accident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to my\n&#39;, &#39;slavery for ever.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;These feelings dictated my answer to my father. I expressed a wish to\n&#39;, &#39;visit England, but concealing the true reasons of this request, I\n&#39;, &#39;clothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion, while I\n&#39;, &#39;urged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to\n&#39;, &#39;comply. After so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that\n&#39;, &#39;resembled madness in its intensity and effects, he was glad to find\n&#39;, &#39;that I was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey,\n&#39;, &#39;and he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would, before my\n&#39;, &#39;return, have restored me entirely to myself.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;The duration of my absence was left to my own choice; a few months, or\n&#39;, &#39;at most a year, was the period contemplated. One paternal kind\n&#39;, &#39;precaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion. Without\n&#39;, &#39;previously communicating with me, he had, in concert with Elizabeth,\n&#39;, &#39;arranged that Clerval should join me at Strasburgh. This interfered\n&#39;, &#39;with the solitude I coveted for the prosecution of my task; yet at the\n&#39;, &#39;commencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be\n&#39;, &#39;an impediment, and truly I rejoiced that thus I should be saved many\n&#39;, &#39;hours of lonely, maddening reflection. Nay, Henry might stand between\n&#39;, &#39;me and the intrusion of my foe. If I were alone, would he not at times\n&#39;, &#39;force his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to\n&#39;, &#39;contemplate its progress?\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;To England, therefore, I was bound, and it was understood that my union\n&#39;, &#39;with Elizabeth should take place immediately on my return. My father’s\n&#39;, &#39;age rendered him extremely averse to delay. For myself, there was one\n&#39;, &#39;reward I promised myself from my detested toils—one consolation for my\n&#39;, &#39;unparalleled sufferings; it was the prospect of that day when,\n&#39;, &#39;enfranchised from my miserable slavery, I might claim Elizabeth and\n&#39;, &#39;forget the past in my union with her.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I now made arrangements for my journey, but one feeling haunted me\n&#39;, &#39;which filled me with fear and agitation. During my absence I should\n&#39;, &#39;leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and\n&#39;, &#39;unprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my\n&#39;, &#39;departure. But he had promised to follow me wherever I might go, and\n&#39;, &#39;would he not accompany me to England? This imagination was dreadful in\n&#39;, &#39;itself, but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends.\n&#39;, &#39;I was agonised with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of\n&#39;, &#39;this might happen. But through the whole period during which I was the\n&#39;, &#39;slave of my creature I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of\n&#39;, &#39;the moment; and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend\n&#39;, &#39;would follow me and exempt my family from the danger of his\n&#39;, &#39;machinations.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;It was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native\n&#39;, &#39;country. My journey had been my own suggestion, and Elizabeth\n&#39;, &#39;therefore acquiesced, but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of\n&#39;, &#39;my suffering, away from her, the inroads of misery and grief. It had\n&#39;, &#39;been her care which provided me a companion in Clerval—and yet a man\n&#39;, &#39;is blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a woman’s\n&#39;, &#39;sedulous attention. She longed to bid me hasten my return; a thousand\n&#39;, &#39;conflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful, silent\n&#39;, &#39;farewell.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away, hardly\n&#39;, &#39;knowing whither I was going, and careless of what was passing around.\n&#39;, &#39;I remembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on\n&#39;, &#39;it, to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with\n&#39;, &#39;me. Filled with dreary imaginations, I passed through many beautiful\n&#39;, &#39;and majestic scenes, but my eyes were fixed and unobserving. I could\n&#39;, &#39;only think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupy\n&#39;, &#39;me whilst they endured.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;After some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversed\n&#39;, &#39;many leagues, I arrived at Strasburgh, where I waited two days for\n&#39;, &#39;Clerval. He came. Alas, how great was the contrast between us! He\n&#39;, &#39;was alive to every new scene, joyful when he saw the beauties of the\n&#39;, &#39;setting sun, and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new\n&#39;, &#39;day. He pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and\n&#39;, &#39;the appearances of the sky. “This is what it is to live,” he cried;\n&#39;, &#39;“now I enjoy existence! But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are\n&#39;, &#39;you desponding and sorrowful!” In truth, I was occupied by gloomy\n&#39;, &#39;thoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden\n&#39;, &#39;sunrise reflected in the Rhine. And you, my friend, would be far more\n&#39;, &#39;amused with the journal of Clerval, who observed the scenery with an\n&#39;, &#39;eye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections. I, a\n&#39;, &#39;miserable wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to\n&#39;, &#39;enjoyment.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;We had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasburgh to\n&#39;, &#39;Rotterdam, whence we might take shipping for London. During this\n&#39;, &#39;voyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns.\n&#39;, &#39;We stayed a day at Mannheim, and on the fifth from our departure from\n&#39;, &#39;Strasburgh, arrived at Mainz. The course of the Rhine below Mainz\n&#39;, &#39;becomes much more picturesque. The river descends rapidly and winds\n&#39;, &#39;between hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms. We saw\n&#39;, &#39;many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by\n&#39;, &#39;black woods, high and inaccessible. This part of the Rhine, indeed,\n&#39;, &#39;presents a singularly variegated landscape. In one spot you view\n&#39;, &#39;rugged hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with\n&#39;, &#39;the dark Rhine rushing beneath; and on the sudden turn of a promontory,\n&#39;, &#39;flourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river\n&#39;, &#39;and populous towns occupy the scene.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;We travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers\n&#39;, &#39;as we glided down the stream. Even I, depressed in mind, and my spirits\n&#39;, &#39;continually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased. I lay at the\n&#39;, &#39;bottom of the boat, and as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to\n&#39;, &#39;drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger. And if these\n&#39;, &#39;were my sensations, who can describe those of Henry? He felt as if he had\n&#39;, &#39;been transported to Fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by\n&#39;, &#39;man. “I have seen,” he said, “the most beautiful scenes\n&#39;, &#39;of my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the\n&#39;, &#39;snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water, casting black\n&#39;, &#39;and impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance\n&#39;, &#39;were it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay\n&#39;, &#39;appearance; I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore\n&#39;, &#39;up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must be\n&#39;, &#39;on the great ocean; and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain,\n&#39;, &#39;where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and\n&#39;, &#39;where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the\n&#39;, &#39;nightly wind; I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud;\n&#39;, &#39;but this country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders. The\n&#39;, &#39;mountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange, but there is a\n&#39;, &#39;charm in the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled.\n&#39;, &#39;Look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the\n&#39;, &#39;island, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now\n&#39;, &#39;that group of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village\n&#39;, &#39;half hid in the recess of the mountain. Oh, surely the spirit that inhabits\n&#39;, &#39;and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who\n&#39;, &#39;pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of\n&#39;, &#39;our own country.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Clerval! Beloved friend! Even now it delights me to record your words and\n&#39;, &#39;to dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving. He was a\n&#39;, &#39;being formed in the “very poetry of nature.” His wild and\n&#39;, &#39;enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart. His\n&#39;, &#39;soul overflowed with ardent affections, and his friendship was of that\n&#39;, &#39;devoted and wondrous nature that the worldly-minded teach us to look for only\n&#39;, &#39;in the imagination. But even human sympathies were not sufficient to\n&#39;, &#39;satisfy his eager mind. The scenery of external nature, which others regard\n&#39;, &#39;only with admiration, he loved with ardour:—\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;    ——The sounding cataract\n&#39;, &#39;    Haunted him like a passion: the tall rock,\n&#39;, &#39;    The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,\n&#39;, &#39;    Their colours and their forms, were then to him\n&#39;, &#39;    An appetite; a feeling, and a love,\n&#39;, &#39;    That had no need of a remoter charm,\n&#39;, &#39;    By thought supplied, or any interest\n&#39;, &#39;    Unborrow’d from the eye.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;          [Wordsworth’s “Tintern Abbey”.]\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;And where does he now exist? Is this gentle and lovely being lost\n&#39;, &#39;for ever? Has this mind, so replete with ideas, imaginations fanciful\n&#39;, &#39;and magnificent, which formed a world, whose existence depended on the\n&#39;, &#39;life of its creator;—has this mind perished? Does it now only exist\n&#39;, &#39;in my memory? No, it is not thus; your form so divinely wrought, and\n&#39;, &#39;beaming with beauty, has decayed, but your spirit still visits and\n&#39;, &#39;consoles your unhappy friend.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Pardon this gush of sorrow; these ineffectual words are but a slight\n&#39;, &#39;tribute to the unexampled worth of Henry, but they soothe my heart,\n&#39;, &#39;overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates. I will\n&#39;, &#39;proceed with my tale.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Beyond Cologne we descended to the plains of Holland; and we resolved to\n&#39;, &#39;post the remainder of our way, for the wind was contrary and the stream of\n&#39;, &#39;the river was too gentle to aid us.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery, but we\n&#39;, &#39;arrived in a few days at Rotterdam, whence we proceeded by sea to England.\n&#39;, &#39;It was on a clear morning, in the latter days of December, that I first saw\n&#39;, &#39;the white cliffs of Britain. The banks of the Thames presented a new scene;\n&#39;, &#39;they were flat but fertile, and almost every town was marked by the\n&#39;, &#39;remembrance of some story. We saw Tilbury Fort and remembered the Spanish\n&#39;, &#39;Armada, Gravesend, Woolwich, and Greenwich—places which I had heard\n&#39;, &#39;of even in my country.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;At length we saw the numerous steeples of London, St. Paul’s towering\n&#39;, &#39;above all, and the Tower famed in English history.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Chapter 19\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;London was our present point of rest; we determined to remain several\n&#39;, &#39;months in this wonderful and celebrated city. Clerval desired the\n&#39;, &#39;intercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this\n&#39;, &#39;time, but this was with me a secondary object; I was principally\n&#39;, &#39;occupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the\n&#39;, &#39;completion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters of\n&#39;, &#39;introduction that I had brought with me, addressed to the most\n&#39;, &#39;distinguished natural philosophers.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;If this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness,\n&#39;, &#39;it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure. But a blight had\n&#39;, &#39;come over my existence, and I only visited these people for the sake of\n&#39;, &#39;the information they might give me on the subject in which my interest\n&#39;, &#39;was so terribly profound. Company was irksome to me; when alone, I\n&#39;, &#39;could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth; the voice of\n&#39;, &#39;Henry soothed me, and I could thus cheat myself into a transitory\n&#39;, &#39;peace. But busy, uninteresting, joyous faces brought back despair to\n&#39;, &#39;my heart. I saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my\n&#39;, &#39;fellow men; this barrier was sealed with the blood of William and\n&#39;, &#39;Justine, and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled\n&#39;, &#39;my soul with anguish.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;But in Clerval I saw the image of my former self; he was inquisitive\n&#39;, &#39;and anxious to gain experience and instruction. The difference of\n&#39;, &#39;manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of\n&#39;, &#39;instruction and amusement. He was also pursuing an object he had long\n&#39;, &#39;had in view. His design was to visit India, in the belief that he had\n&#39;, &#39;in his knowledge of its various languages, and in the views he had\n&#39;, &#39;taken of its society, the means of materially assisting the progress of\n&#39;, &#39;European colonization and trade. In Britain only could he further the\n&#39;, &#39;execution of his plan. He was for ever busy, and the only check to his\n&#39;, &#39;enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind. I tried to conceal this\n&#39;, &#39;as much as possible, that I might not debar him from the pleasures\n&#39;, &#39;natural to one who was entering on a new scene of life, undisturbed by\n&#39;, &#39;any care or bitter recollection. I often refused to accompany him,\n&#39;, &#39;alleging another engagement, that I might remain alone. I now also\n&#39;, &#39;began to collect the materials necessary for my new creation, and this\n&#39;, &#39;was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling\n&#39;, &#39;on the head. Every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme\n&#39;, &#39;anguish, and every word that I spoke in allusion to it caused my lips\n&#39;, &#39;to quiver, and my heart to palpitate.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;After passing some months in London, we received a letter from a person in\n&#39;, &#39;Scotland who had formerly been our visitor at Geneva. He mentioned the\n&#39;, &#39;beauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient\n&#39;, &#39;allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as Perth,\n&#39;, &#39;where he resided. Clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation, and I,\n&#39;, &#39;although I abhorred society, wished to view again mountains and streams and\n&#39;, &#39;all the wondrous works with which Nature adorns her chosen dwelling-places.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;We had arrived in England at the beginning of October, and it was now\n&#39;, &#39;February. We accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the\n&#39;, &#39;north at the expiration of another month. In this expedition we did not\n&#39;, &#39;intend to follow the great road to Edinburgh, but to visit Windsor, Oxford,\n&#39;, &#39;Matlock, and the Cumberland lakes, resolving to arrive at the completion of\n&#39;, &#39;this tour about the end of July. I packed up my chemical instruments and\n&#39;, &#39;the materials I had collected, resolving to finish my labours in some\n&#39;, &#39;obscure nook in the northern highlands of Scotland.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;We quitted London on the 27th of March and remained a few days at\n&#39;, &#39;Windsor, rambling in its beautiful forest. This was a new scene to us\n&#39;, &#39;mountaineers; the majestic oaks, the quantity of game, and the herds of\n&#39;, &#39;stately deer were all novelties to us.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;From thence we proceeded to Oxford. As we entered this city, our minds\n&#39;, &#39;were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted\n&#39;, &#39;there more than a century and a half before. It was here that Charles\n&#39;, &#39;I. had collected his forces. This city had remained faithful to him,\n&#39;, &#39;after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of\n&#39;, &#39;Parliament and liberty. The memory of that unfortunate king and his\n&#39;, &#39;companions, the amiable Falkland, the insolent Goring, his queen, and\n&#39;, &#39;son, gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they\n&#39;, &#39;might be supposed to have inhabited. The spirit of elder days found a\n&#39;, &#39;dwelling here, and we delighted to trace its footsteps. If these\n&#39;, &#39;feelings had not found an imaginary gratification, the appearance of\n&#39;, &#39;the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration.\n&#39;, &#39;The colleges are ancient and picturesque; the streets are almost\n&#39;, &#39;magnificent; and the lovely Isis, which flows beside it through meadows\n&#39;, &#39;of exquisite verdure, is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters,\n&#39;, &#39;which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers, and spires, and\n&#39;, &#39;domes, embosomed among aged trees.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I enjoyed this scene, and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the\n&#39;, &#39;memory of the past and the anticipation of the future. I was formed\n&#39;, &#39;for peaceful happiness. During my youthful days discontent never\n&#39;, &#39;visited my mind, and if I was ever overcome by _ennui_, the sight of what\n&#39;, &#39;is beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in\n&#39;, &#39;the productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate\n&#39;, &#39;elasticity to my spirits. But I am a blasted tree; the bolt has\n&#39;, &#39;entered my soul; and I felt then that I should survive to exhibit what\n&#39;, &#39;I shall soon cease to be—a miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity,\n&#39;, &#39;pitiable to others and intolerable to myself.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;We passed a considerable period at Oxford, rambling among its environs\n&#39;, &#39;and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most\n&#39;, &#39;animating epoch of English history. Our little voyages of discovery\n&#39;, &#39;were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented\n&#39;, &#39;themselves. We visited the tomb of the illustrious Hampden and the\n&#39;, &#39;field on which that patriot fell. For a moment my soul was elevated\n&#39;, &#39;from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas\n&#39;, &#39;of liberty and self-sacrifice of which these sights were the monuments\n&#39;, &#39;and the remembrancers. For an instant I dared to shake off my chains\n&#39;, &#39;and look around me with a free and lofty spirit, but the iron had eaten\n&#39;, &#39;into my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my\n&#39;, &#39;miserable self.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;We left Oxford with regret and proceeded to Matlock, which was our next\n&#39;, &#39;place of rest. The country in the neighbourhood of this village\n&#39;, &#39;resembled, to a greater degree, the scenery of Switzerland; but\n&#39;, &#39;everything is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of\n&#39;, &#39;distant white Alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my\n&#39;, &#39;native country. We visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets\n&#39;, &#39;of natural history, where the curiosities are disposed in the same\n&#39;, &#39;manner as in the collections at Servox and Chamounix. The latter name\n&#39;, &#39;made me tremble when pronounced by Henry, and I hastened to quit\n&#39;, &#39;Matlock, with which that terrible scene was thus associated.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;From Derby, still journeying northwards, we passed two months in\n&#39;, &#39;Cumberland and Westmorland. I could now almost fancy myself among the\n&#39;, &#39;Swiss mountains. The little patches of snow which yet lingered on the\n&#39;, &#39;northern sides of the mountains, the lakes, and the dashing of the\n&#39;, &#39;rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me. Here also we\n&#39;, &#39;made some acquaintances, who almost contrived to cheat me into\n&#39;, &#39;happiness. The delight of Clerval was proportionably greater than\n&#39;, &#39;mine; his mind expanded in the company of men of talent, and he found\n&#39;, &#39;in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have\n&#39;, &#39;imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his\n&#39;, &#39;inferiors. “I could pass my life here,” said he to me; “and among\n&#39;, &#39;these mountains I should scarcely regret Switzerland and the Rhine.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;But he found that a traveller’s life is one that includes much pain\n&#39;, &#39;amidst its enjoyments. His feelings are for ever on the stretch; and\n&#39;, &#39;when he begins to sink into repose, he finds himself obliged to quit\n&#39;, &#39;that on which he rests in pleasure for something new, which again\n&#39;, &#39;engages his attention, and which also he forsakes for other novelties.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;We had scarcely visited the various lakes of Cumberland and Westmorland\n&#39;, &#39;and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period\n&#39;, &#39;of our appointment with our Scotch friend approached, and we left them\n&#39;, &#39;to travel on. For my own part I was not sorry. I had now neglected my\n&#39;, &#39;promise for some time, and I feared the effects of the dæmon’s\n&#39;, &#39;disappointment. He might remain in Switzerland and wreak his vengeance\n&#39;, &#39;on my relatives. This idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment\n&#39;, &#39;from which I might otherwise have snatched repose and peace. I waited\n&#39;, &#39;for my letters with feverish impatience; if they were delayed I was\n&#39;, &#39;miserable and overcome by a thousand fears; and when they arrived and I\n&#39;, &#39;saw the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to\n&#39;, &#39;read and ascertain my fate. Sometimes I thought that the fiend\n&#39;, &#39;followed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion.\n&#39;, &#39;When these thoughts possessed me, I would not quit Henry for a moment,\n&#39;, &#39;but followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of\n&#39;, &#39;his destroyer. I felt as if I had committed some great crime, the\n&#39;, &#39;consciousness of which haunted me. I was guiltless, but I had indeed\n&#39;, &#39;drawn down a horrible curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I visited Edinburgh with languid eyes and mind; and yet that city might\n&#39;, &#39;have interested the most unfortunate being. Clerval did not like it so well\n&#39;, &#39;as Oxford, for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him.\n&#39;, &#39;But the beauty and regularity of the new town of Edinburgh, its romantic\n&#39;, &#39;castle and its environs, the most delightful in the world, Arthur’s\n&#39;, &#39;Seat, St. Bernard’s Well, and the Pentland Hills, compensated him for\n&#39;, &#39;the change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration. But I was\n&#39;, &#39;impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;We left Edinburgh in a week, passing through Coupar, St. Andrew’s, and\n&#39;, &#39;along the banks of the Tay, to Perth, where our friend expected us.\n&#39;, &#39;But I was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into\n&#39;, &#39;their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and\n&#39;, &#39;accordingly I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Scotland\n&#39;, &#39;alone. “Do you,” said I, “enjoy yourself, and let this be our\n&#39;, &#39;rendezvous. I may be absent a month or two; but do not interfere with\n&#39;, &#39;my motions, I entreat you; leave me to peace and solitude for a short\n&#39;, &#39;time; and when I return, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more\n&#39;, &#39;congenial to your own temper.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Henry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this plan, ceased to\n&#39;, &#39;remonstrate. He entreated me to write often. “I had rather be with\n&#39;, &#39;you,” he said, “in your solitary rambles, than with these Scotch\n&#39;, &#39;people, whom I do not know; hasten, then, my dear friend, to return,\n&#39;, &#39;that I may again feel myself somewhat at home, which I cannot do in\n&#39;, &#39;your absence.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Having parted from my friend, I determined to visit some remote spot of\n&#39;, &#39;Scotland and finish my work in solitude. I did not doubt but that the\n&#39;, &#39;monster followed me and would discover himself to me when I should have\n&#39;, &#39;finished, that he might receive his companion.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;With this resolution I traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of\n&#39;, &#39;the remotest of the Orkneys as the scene of my labours. It was a place\n&#39;, &#39;fitted for such a work, being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were\n&#39;, &#39;continually beaten upon by the waves. The soil was barren, scarcely\n&#39;, &#39;affording pasture for a few miserable cows, and oatmeal for its\n&#39;, &#39;inhabitants, which consisted of five persons, whose gaunt and scraggy limbs\n&#39;, &#39;gave tokens of their miserable fare. Vegetables and bread, when they\n&#39;, &#39;indulged in such luxuries, and even fresh water, was to be procured from\n&#39;, &#39;the mainland, which was about five miles distant.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;On the whole island there were but three miserable huts, and one of\n&#39;, &#39;these was vacant when I arrived. This I hired. It contained but two\n&#39;, &#39;rooms, and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable\n&#39;, &#39;penury. The thatch had fallen in, the walls were unplastered, and the\n&#39;, &#39;door was off its hinges. I ordered it to be repaired, bought some\n&#39;, &#39;furniture, and took possession, an incident which would doubtless have\n&#39;, &#39;occasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been\n&#39;, &#39;benumbed by want and squalid poverty. As it was, I lived ungazed at\n&#39;, &#39;and unmolested, hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes\n&#39;, &#39;which I gave, so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations\n&#39;, &#39;of men.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;In this retreat I devoted the morning to labour; but in the evening,\n&#39;, &#39;when the weather permitted, I walked on the stony beach of the sea to\n&#39;, &#39;listen to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet. It was a\n&#39;, &#39;monotonous yet ever-changing scene. I thought of Switzerland; it was\n&#39;, &#39;far different from this desolate and appalling landscape. Its hills\n&#39;, &#39;are covered with vines, and its cottages are scattered thickly in the\n&#39;, &#39;plains. Its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky, and when\n&#39;, &#39;troubled by the winds, their tumult is but as the play of a lively\n&#39;, &#39;infant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;In this manner I distributed my occupations when I first arrived, but\n&#39;, &#39;as I proceeded in my labour, it became every day more horrible and\n&#39;, &#39;irksome to me. Sometimes I could not prevail on myself to enter my\n&#39;, &#39;laboratory for several days, and at other times I toiled day and night\n&#39;, &#39;in order to complete my work. It was, indeed, a filthy process in\n&#39;, &#39;which I was engaged. During my first experiment, a kind of\n&#39;, &#39;enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment; my\n&#39;, &#39;mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour, and my eyes\n&#39;, &#39;were shut to the horror of my proceedings. But now I went to it in\n&#39;, &#39;cold blood, and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Thus situated, employed in the most detestable occupation, immersed in\n&#39;, &#39;a solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from\n&#39;, &#39;the actual scene in which I was engaged, my spirits became unequal; I\n&#39;, &#39;grew restless and nervous. Every moment I feared to meet my\n&#39;, &#39;persecutor. Sometimes I sat with my eyes fixed on the ground, fearing\n&#39;, &#39;to raise them lest they should encounter the object which I so much\n&#39;, &#39;dreaded to behold. I feared to wander from the sight of my fellow\n&#39;, &#39;creatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;In the mean time I worked on, and my labour was already considerably\n&#39;, &#39;advanced. I looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager\n&#39;, &#39;hope, which I dared not trust myself to question but which was\n&#39;, &#39;intermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken\n&#39;, &#39;in my bosom.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Chapter 20\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I sat one evening in my laboratory; the sun had set, and the moon was just\n&#39;, &#39;rising from the sea; I had not sufficient light for my employment, and I\n&#39;, &#39;remained idle, in a pause of consideration of whether I should leave my\n&#39;, &#39;labour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention\n&#39;, &#39;to it. As I sat, a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to\n&#39;, &#39;consider the effects of what I was now doing. Three years before, I was\n&#39;, &#39;engaged in the same manner and had created a fiend whose unparalleled\n&#39;, &#39;barbarity had desolated my heart and filled it for ever with the bitterest\n&#39;, &#39;remorse. I was now about to form another being of whose dispositions I was\n&#39;, &#39;alike ignorant; she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her\n&#39;, &#39;mate and delight, for its own sake, in murder and wretchedness. He had\n&#39;, &#39;sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts, but she\n&#39;, &#39;had not; and she, who in all probability was to become a thinking and\n&#39;, &#39;reasoning animal, might refuse to comply with a compact made before her\n&#39;, &#39;creation. They might even hate each other; the creature who already lived\n&#39;, &#39;loathed his own deformity, and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence\n&#39;, &#39;for it when it came before his eyes in the female form? She also might turn\n&#39;, &#39;with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man; she might quit him,\n&#39;, &#39;and he be again alone, exasperated by the fresh provocation of being\n&#39;, &#39;deserted by one of his own species.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Even if they were to leave Europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world,\n&#39;, &#39;yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the dæmon\n&#39;, &#39;thirsted would be children, and a race of devils would be propagated upon\n&#39;, &#39;the earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a\n&#39;, &#39;condition precarious and full of terror. Had I right, for my own benefit,\n&#39;, &#39;to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations? I had before been moved\n&#39;, &#39;by the sophisms of the being I had created; I had been struck senseless by\n&#39;, &#39;his fiendish threats; but now, for the first time, the wickedness of my\n&#39;, &#39;promise burst upon me; I shuddered to think that future ages might curse me\n&#39;, &#39;as their pest, whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at\n&#39;, &#39;the price, perhaps, of the existence of the whole human race.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I trembled and my heart failed within me, when, on looking up, I saw by\n&#39;, &#39;the light of the moon the dæmon at the casement. A ghastly grin\n&#39;, &#39;wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me, where I sat fulfilling the task\n&#39;, &#39;which he had allotted to me. Yes, he had followed me in my travels; he\n&#39;, &#39;had loitered in forests, hid himself in caves, or taken refuge in wide\n&#39;, &#39;and desert heaths; and he now came to mark my progress and claim the\n&#39;, &#39;fulfilment of my promise.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;As I looked on him, his countenance expressed the utmost extent of\n&#39;, &#39;malice and treachery. I thought with a sensation of madness on my\n&#39;, &#39;promise of creating another like to him, and trembling with passion,\n&#39;, &#39;tore to pieces the thing on which I was engaged. The wretch saw me\n&#39;, &#39;destroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for\n&#39;, &#39;happiness, and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge, withdrew.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I left the room, and locking the door, made a solemn vow in my own\n&#39;, &#39;heart never to resume my labours; and then, with trembling steps, I\n&#39;, &#39;sought my own apartment. I was alone; none were near me to dissipate\n&#39;, &#39;the gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most\n&#39;, &#39;terrible reveries.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Several hours passed, and I remained near my window gazing on the sea;\n&#39;, &#39;it was almost motionless, for the winds were hushed, and all nature\n&#39;, &#39;reposed under the eye of the quiet moon. A few fishing vessels alone\n&#39;, &#39;specked the water, and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound\n&#39;, &#39;of voices as the fishermen called to one another. I felt the silence,\n&#39;, &#39;although I was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity, until my ear\n&#39;, &#39;was suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore, and a\n&#39;, &#39;person landed close to my house.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;In a few minutes after, I heard the creaking of my door, as if some one\n&#39;, &#39;endeavoured to open it softly. I trembled from head to foot; I felt a\n&#39;, &#39;presentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who\n&#39;, &#39;dwelt in a cottage not far from mine; but I was overcome by the sensation\n&#39;, &#39;of helplessness, so often felt in frightful dreams, when you in vain\n&#39;, &#39;endeavour to fly from an impending danger, and was rooted to the spot.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Presently I heard the sound of footsteps along the passage; the door\n&#39;, &#39;opened, and the wretch whom I dreaded appeared. Shutting the door, he\n&#39;, &#39;approached me and said in a smothered voice,\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“You have destroyed the work which you began; what is it that you\n&#39;, &#39;intend? Do you dare to break your promise? I have endured toil and misery;\n&#39;, &#39;I left Switzerland with you; I crept along the shores of the Rhine, among\n&#39;, &#39;its willow islands and over the summits of its hills. I have dwelt many\n&#39;, &#39;months in the heaths of England and among the deserts of Scotland. I have\n&#39;, &#39;endured incalculable fatigue, and cold, and hunger; do you dare destroy my\n&#39;, &#39;hopes?”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Begone! I do break my promise; never will I create another like\n&#39;, &#39;yourself, equal in deformity and wickedness.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Slave, I before reasoned with you, but you have proved yourself\n&#39;, &#39;unworthy of my condescension. Remember that I have power; you believe\n&#39;, &#39;yourself miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light of\n&#39;, &#39;day will be hateful to you. You are my creator, but I am your master;\n&#39;, &#39;obey!”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“The hour of my irresolution is past, and the period of your power is\n&#39;, &#39;arrived. Your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness; but\n&#39;, &#39;they confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in\n&#39;, &#39;vice. Shall I, in cool blood, set loose upon the earth a dæmon whose\n&#39;, &#39;delight is in death and wretchedness? Begone! I am firm, and your\n&#39;, &#39;words will only exasperate my rage.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;The monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in the\n&#39;, &#39;impotence of anger. “Shall each man,” cried he, “find a\n&#39;, &#39;wife for his bosom, and each beast have his mate, and I be alone? I had\n&#39;, &#39;feelings of affection, and they were requited by detestation and scorn.\n&#39;, &#39;Man! You may hate, but beware! Your hours will pass in dread and misery,\n&#39;, &#39;and soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness for\n&#39;, &#39;ever. Are you to be happy while I grovel in the intensity of my\n&#39;, &#39;wretchedness? You can blast my other passions, but revenge\n&#39;, &#39;remains—revenge, henceforth dearer than light or food! I may die, but\n&#39;, &#39;first you, my tyrant and tormentor, shall curse the sun that gazes on your\n&#39;, &#39;misery. Beware, for I am fearless and therefore powerful. I will watch with\n&#39;, &#39;the wiliness of a snake, that I may sting with its venom. Man, you shall\n&#39;, &#39;repent of the injuries you inflict.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Devil, cease; and do not poison the air with these sounds of malice.\n&#39;, &#39;I have declared my resolution to you, and I am no coward to bend\n&#39;, &#39;beneath words. Leave me; I am inexorable.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“It is well. I go; but remember, I shall be with you on your\n&#39;, &#39;wedding-night.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I started forward and exclaimed, “Villain! Before you sign my\n&#39;, &#39;death-warrant, be sure that you are yourself safe.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I would have seized him, but he eluded me and quitted the house with\n&#39;, &#39;precipitation. In a few moments I saw him in his boat, which shot\n&#39;, &#39;across the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the\n&#39;, &#39;waves.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;All was again silent, but his words rang in my ears. I burned with rage to\n&#39;, &#39;pursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean. I\n&#39;, &#39;walked up and down my room hastily and perturbed, while my imagination\n&#39;, &#39;conjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me. Why had I not\n&#39;, &#39;followed him and closed with him in mortal strife? But I had suffered him\n&#39;, &#39;to depart, and he had directed his course towards the mainland. I shuddered\n&#39;, &#39;to think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge.\n&#39;, &#39;And then I thought again of his words—“_I will be with you on\n&#39;, &#39;your wedding-night._” That, then, was the period fixed for the\n&#39;, &#39;fulfilment of my destiny. In that hour I should die and at once satisfy and\n&#39;, &#39;extinguish his malice. The prospect did not move me to fear; yet when I\n&#39;, &#39;thought of my beloved Elizabeth, of her tears and endless sorrow, when she\n&#39;, &#39;should find her lover so barbarously snatched from her, tears, the first I\n&#39;, &#39;had shed for many months, streamed from my eyes, and I resolved not to fall\n&#39;, &#39;before my enemy without a bitter struggle.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;The night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings became\n&#39;, &#39;calmer, if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into\n&#39;, &#39;the depths of despair. I left the house, the horrid scene of the last\n&#39;, &#39;night’s contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which I\n&#39;, &#39;almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow\n&#39;, &#39;creatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me. I\n&#39;, &#39;desired that I might pass my life on that barren rock, wearily, it is true,\n&#39;, &#39;but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery. If I returned, it was to\n&#39;, &#39;be sacrificed or to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of a\n&#39;, &#39;dæmon whom I had myself created.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it\n&#39;, &#39;loved and miserable in the separation. When it became noon, and the\n&#39;, &#39;sun rose higher, I lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep\n&#39;, &#39;sleep. I had been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerves\n&#39;, &#39;were agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery. The sleep\n&#39;, &#39;into which I now sank refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as\n&#39;, &#39;if I belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I began to\n&#39;, &#39;reflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the\n&#39;, &#39;words of the fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell; they appeared\n&#39;, &#39;like a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my\n&#39;, &#39;appetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a\n&#39;, &#39;fishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet;\n&#39;, &#39;it contained letters from Geneva, and one from Clerval entreating me to\n&#39;, &#39;join him. He said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where\n&#39;, &#39;he was, that letters from the friends he had formed in London desired\n&#39;, &#39;his return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his\n&#39;, &#39;Indian enterprise. He could not any longer delay his departure; but as\n&#39;, &#39;his journey to London might be followed, even sooner than he now\n&#39;, &#39;conjectured, by his longer voyage, he entreated me to bestow as much of\n&#39;, &#39;my society on him as I could spare. He besought me, therefore, to\n&#39;, &#39;leave my solitary isle and to meet him at Perth, that we might proceed\n&#39;, &#39;southwards together. This letter in a degree recalled me to life, and\n&#39;, &#39;I determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Yet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I shuddered\n&#39;, &#39;to reflect; I must pack up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose I\n&#39;, &#39;must enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I must\n&#39;, &#39;handle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me. The next\n&#39;, &#39;morning, at daybreak, I summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door\n&#39;, &#39;of my laboratory. The remains of the half-finished creature, whom I had\n&#39;, &#39;destroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had\n&#39;, &#39;mangled the living flesh of a human being. I paused to collect myself and\n&#39;, &#39;then entered the chamber. With trembling hand I conveyed the instruments\n&#39;, &#39;out of the room, but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of my\n&#39;, &#39;work to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and I accordingly\n&#39;, &#39;put them into a basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying them\n&#39;, &#39;up, determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in the\n&#39;, &#39;meantime I sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and arranging my\n&#39;, &#39;chemical apparatus.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place\n&#39;, &#39;in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the dæmon. I had\n&#39;, &#39;before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with\n&#39;, &#39;whatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film\n&#39;, &#39;had been taken from before my eyes and that I for the first time saw\n&#39;, &#39;clearly. The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur\n&#39;, &#39;to me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not\n&#39;, &#39;reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it. I had resolved in\n&#39;, &#39;my own mind that to create another like the fiend I had first made\n&#39;, &#39;would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and I\n&#39;, &#39;banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different\n&#39;, &#39;conclusion.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my\n&#39;, &#39;basket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore.\n&#39;, &#39;The scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land,\n&#39;, &#39;but I sailed away from them. I felt as if I was about the commission of a\n&#39;, &#39;dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my\n&#39;, &#39;fellow creatures. At one time the moon, which had before been clear, was\n&#39;, &#39;suddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of\n&#39;, &#39;darkness and cast my basket into the sea; I listened to the gurgling sound\n&#39;, &#39;as it sank and then sailed away from the spot. The sky became clouded, but\n&#39;, &#39;the air was pure, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then\n&#39;, &#39;rising. But it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations\n&#39;, &#39;that I resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a\n&#39;, &#39;direct position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat. Clouds hid the\n&#39;, &#39;moon, everything was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat as its\n&#39;, &#39;keel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I\n&#39;, &#39;slept soundly.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I\n&#39;, &#39;found that the sun had already mounted considerably. The wind was high, and\n&#39;, &#39;the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff. I found\n&#39;, &#39;that the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from\n&#39;, &#39;which I had embarked. I endeavoured to change my course but quickly found\n&#39;, &#39;that if I again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with\n&#39;, &#39;water. Thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind. I\n&#39;, &#39;confess that I felt a few sensations of terror. I had no compass with me\n&#39;, &#39;and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the\n&#39;, &#39;world that the sun was of little benefit to me. I might be driven into the\n&#39;, &#39;wide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in\n&#39;, &#39;the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me. I had already\n&#39;, &#39;been out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to\n&#39;, &#39;my other sufferings. I looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds\n&#39;, &#39;that flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others; I looked upon the\n&#39;, &#39;sea; it was to be my grave. “Fiend,” I exclaimed, “your\n&#39;, &#39;task is already fulfilled!” I thought of Elizabeth, of my father, and\n&#39;, &#39;of Clerval—all left behind, on whom the monster might satisfy his\n&#39;, &#39;sanguinary and merciless passions. This idea plunged me into a reverie so\n&#39;, &#39;despairing and frightful that even now, when the scene is on the point of\n&#39;, &#39;closing before me for ever, I shudder to reflect on it.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the\n&#39;, &#39;horizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became\n&#39;, &#39;free from breakers. But these gave place to a heavy swell; I felt sick\n&#39;, &#39;and hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly I saw a line of high\n&#39;, &#39;land towards the south.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I endured\n&#39;, &#39;for several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of\n&#39;, &#39;warm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have\n&#39;, &#39;of life even in the excess of misery! I constructed another sail with a\n&#39;, &#39;part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land. It had a\n&#39;, &#39;wild and rocky appearance, but as I approached nearer I easily perceived\n&#39;, &#39;the traces of cultivation. I saw vessels near the shore and found myself\n&#39;, &#39;suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man. I\n&#39;, &#39;carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which I at\n&#39;, &#39;length saw issuing from behind a small promontory. As I was in a state of\n&#39;, &#39;extreme debility, I resolved to sail directly towards the town, as a place\n&#39;, &#39;where I could most easily procure nourishment. Fortunately I had money with\n&#39;, &#39;me. As I turned the promontory I perceived a small neat town and a good\n&#39;, &#39;harbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected\n&#39;, &#39;escape.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several\n&#39;, &#39;people crowded towards the spot. They seemed much surprised at my\n&#39;, &#39;appearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whispered\n&#39;, &#39;together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me\n&#39;, &#39;a slight sensation of alarm. As it was, I merely remarked that they\n&#39;, &#39;spoke English, and I therefore addressed them in that language. “My\n&#39;, &#39;good friends,” said I, “will you be so kind as to tell me the name of\n&#39;, &#39;this town and inform me where I am?”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“You will know that soon enough,” replied a man with a hoarse voice.\n&#39;, &#39;“Maybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste,\n&#39;, &#39;but you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a\n&#39;, &#39;stranger, and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and\n&#39;, &#39;angry countenances of his companions. “Why do you answer me so\n&#39;, &#39;roughly?” I replied. “Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to\n&#39;, &#39;receive strangers so inhospitably.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I do not know,” said the man, “what the custom of the\n&#39;, &#39;English may be, but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;While this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly\n&#39;, &#39;increase. Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which\n&#39;, &#39;annoyed and in some degree alarmed me. I inquired the way to the inn, but\n&#39;, &#39;no one replied. I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the\n&#39;, &#39;crowd as they followed and surrounded me, when an ill-looking man\n&#39;, &#39;approaching tapped me on the shoulder and said, “Come, sir, you must\n&#39;, &#39;follow me to Mr. Kirwin’s to give an account of yourself.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Who is Mr. Kirwin? Why am I to give an account of myself? Is not\n&#39;, &#39;this a free country?”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Ay, sir, free enough for honest folks. Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate,\n&#39;, &#39;and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was\n&#39;, &#39;found murdered here last night.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;This answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself. I was innocent;\n&#39;, &#39;that could easily be proved; accordingly I followed my conductor in silence\n&#39;, &#39;and was led to one of the best houses in the town. I was ready to sink from\n&#39;, &#39;fatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic\n&#39;, &#39;to rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed into\n&#39;, &#39;apprehension or conscious guilt. Little did I then expect the calamity that\n&#39;, &#39;was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair\n&#39;, &#39;all fear of ignominy or death.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I must pause here, for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of\n&#39;, &#39;the frightful events which I am about to relate, in proper detail, to my\n&#39;, &#39;recollection.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Chapter 21\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old\n&#39;, &#39;benevolent man with calm and mild manners. He looked upon me, however,\n&#39;, &#39;with some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors,\n&#39;, &#39;he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;About half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by the\n&#39;, &#39;magistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with\n&#39;, &#39;his son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten o’clock,\n&#39;, &#39;they observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in\n&#39;, &#39;for port. It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did\n&#39;, &#39;not land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about\n&#39;, &#39;two miles below. He walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle,\n&#39;, &#39;and his companions followed him at some distance. As he was proceeding\n&#39;, &#39;along the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his\n&#39;, &#39;length on the ground. His companions came up to assist him, and by the\n&#39;, &#39;light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man,\n&#39;, &#39;who was to all appearance dead. Their first supposition was that it was the\n&#39;, &#39;corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the\n&#39;, &#39;waves, but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even\n&#39;, &#39;that the body was not then cold. They instantly carried it to the cottage\n&#39;, &#39;of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it\n&#39;, &#39;to life. It appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty\n&#39;, &#39;years of age. He had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of\n&#39;, &#39;any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, but\n&#39;, &#39;when the mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered the murder of\n&#39;, &#39;my brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a\n&#39;, &#39;mist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for\n&#39;, &#39;support. The magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew\n&#39;, &#39;an unfavourable augury from my manner.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;The son confirmed his father’s account, but when Daniel Nugent was\n&#39;, &#39;called he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion, he\n&#39;, &#39;saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore;\n&#39;, &#39;and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was the same\n&#39;, &#39;boat in which I had just landed.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;A woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door\n&#39;, &#39;of her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour\n&#39;, &#39;before she heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat with\n&#39;, &#39;only one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse\n&#39;, &#39;was afterwards found.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the\n&#39;, &#39;body into her house; it was not cold. They put it into a bed and\n&#39;, &#39;rubbed it, and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life was\n&#39;, &#39;quite gone.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Several other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreed\n&#39;, &#39;that, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it\n&#39;, &#39;was very probable that I had beaten about for many hours and had been\n&#39;, &#39;obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which I had departed.\n&#39;, &#39;Besides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the body\n&#39;, &#39;from another place, and it was likely that as I did not appear to know\n&#39;, &#39;the shore, I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance\n&#39;, &#39;of the town of —— from the place where I had deposited the corpse.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Mr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken into\n&#39;, &#39;the room where the body lay for interment, that it might be observed what\n&#39;, &#39;effect the sight of it would produce upon me. This idea was probably\n&#39;, &#39;suggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the\n&#39;, &#39;murder had been described. I was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate\n&#39;, &#39;and several other persons, to the inn. I could not help being struck by the\n&#39;, &#39;strange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night; but,\n&#39;, &#39;knowing that I had been conversing with several persons in the island I had\n&#39;, &#39;inhabited about the time that the body had been found, I was perfectly\n&#39;, &#39;tranquil as to the consequences of the affair.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin. How\n&#39;, &#39;can I describe my sensations on beholding it? I feel yet parched with\n&#39;, &#39;horror, nor can I reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and\n&#39;, &#39;agony. The examination, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses,\n&#39;, &#39;passed like a dream from my memory when I saw the lifeless form of Henry\n&#39;, &#39;Clerval stretched before me. I gasped for breath, and throwing myself on\n&#39;, &#39;the body, I exclaimed, “Have my murderous machinations deprived you\n&#39;, &#39;also, my dearest Henry, of life? Two I have already destroyed; other\n&#39;, &#39;victims await their destiny; but you, Clerval, my friend, my\n&#39;, &#39;benefactor—”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;The human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured, and\n&#39;, &#39;I was carried out of the room in strong convulsions.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;A fever succeeded to this. I lay for two months on the point of death; my\n&#39;, &#39;ravings, as I afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the\n&#39;, &#39;murderer of William, of Justine, and of Clerval. Sometimes I entreated my\n&#39;, &#39;attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was\n&#39;, &#39;tormented; and at others I felt the fingers of the monster already grasping\n&#39;, &#39;my neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror. Fortunately, as I spoke\n&#39;, &#39;my native language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood me; but my gestures and\n&#39;, &#39;bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Why did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not\n&#39;, &#39;sink into forgetfulness and rest? Death snatches away many blooming\n&#39;, &#39;children, the only hopes of their doting parents; how many brides and\n&#39;, &#39;youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the\n&#39;, &#39;next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb! Of what materials was I\n&#39;, &#39;made that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of\n&#39;, &#39;the wheel, continually renewed the torture?\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;But I was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from\n&#39;, &#39;a dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by\n&#39;, &#39;gaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon.\n&#39;, &#39;It was morning, I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding; I had\n&#39;, &#39;forgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some\n&#39;, &#39;great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked around\n&#39;, &#39;and saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which I\n&#39;, &#39;was, all flashed across my memory and I groaned bitterly.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside\n&#39;, &#39;me. She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her\n&#39;, &#39;countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise\n&#39;, &#39;that class. The lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of\n&#39;, &#39;persons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery. Her\n&#39;, &#39;tone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in English,\n&#39;, &#39;and the voice struck me as one that I had heard during my sufferings.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Are you better now, sir?” said she.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I replied in the same language, with a feeble voice, “I believe I am;\n&#39;, &#39;but if it be all true, if indeed I did not dream, I am sorry that I am\n&#39;, &#39;still alive to feel this misery and horror.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“For that matter,” replied the old woman, “if you mean about the\n&#39;, &#39;gentleman you murdered, I believe that it were better for you if you\n&#39;, &#39;were dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you! However, that’s none\n&#39;, &#39;of my business; I am sent to nurse you and get you well; I do my duty\n&#39;, &#39;with a safe conscience; it were well if everybody did the same.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a\n&#39;, &#39;speech to a person just saved, on the very edge of death; but I felt\n&#39;, &#39;languid and unable to reflect on all that had passed. The whole series\n&#39;, &#39;of my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it\n&#39;, &#39;were all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force\n&#39;, &#39;of reality.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew\n&#39;, &#39;feverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed\n&#39;, &#39;me with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me. The\n&#39;, &#39;physician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared\n&#39;, &#39;them for me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and the\n&#39;, &#39;expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the\n&#39;, &#39;second. Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the\n&#39;, &#39;hangman who would gain his fee?\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;These were my first reflections, but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had\n&#39;, &#39;shown me extreme kindness. He had caused the best room in the prison\n&#39;, &#39;to be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who\n&#39;, &#39;had provided a physician and a nurse. It is true, he seldom came to\n&#39;, &#39;see me, for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of\n&#39;, &#39;every human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and\n&#39;, &#39;miserable ravings of a murderer. He came, therefore, sometimes to see\n&#39;, &#39;that I was not neglected, but his visits were short and with long\n&#39;, &#39;intervals.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;One day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes\n&#39;, &#39;half open and my cheeks livid like those in death. I was overcome by gloom\n&#39;, &#39;and misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to\n&#39;, &#39;remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness. At one time I\n&#39;, &#39;considered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the\n&#39;, &#39;penalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been. Such were my\n&#39;, &#39;thoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and Mr. Kirwin entered.\n&#39;, &#39;His countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to\n&#39;, &#39;mine and addressed me in French,\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do anything to\n&#39;, &#39;make you more comfortable?”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the whole\n&#39;, &#39;earth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to\n&#39;, &#39;one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune. But you will, I\n&#39;, &#39;hope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can\n&#39;, &#39;easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“That is my least concern; I am, by a course of strange events, become\n&#39;, &#39;the most miserable of mortals. Persecuted and tortured as I am and\n&#39;, &#39;have been, can death be any evil to me?”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the\n&#39;, &#39;strange chances that have lately occurred. You were thrown, by some\n&#39;, &#39;surprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality,\n&#39;, &#39;seized immediately, and charged with murder. The first sight that was\n&#39;, &#39;presented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so\n&#39;, &#39;unaccountable a manner and placed, as it were, by some fiend across\n&#39;, &#39;your path.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;As Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured on\n&#39;, &#39;this retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise at\n&#39;, &#39;the knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me. I suppose some\n&#39;, &#39;astonishment was exhibited in my countenance, for Mr. Kirwin hastened\n&#39;, &#39;to say,\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Immediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were on\n&#39;, &#39;your person were brought me, and I examined them that I might discover some\n&#39;, &#39;trace by which I could send to your relations an account of your misfortune\n&#39;, &#39;and illness. I found several letters, and, among others, one which I\n&#39;, &#39;discovered from its commencement to be from your father. I instantly wrote\n&#39;, &#39;to Geneva; nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter.\n&#39;, &#39;But you are ill; even now you tremble; you are unfit for agitation of any\n&#39;, &#39;kind.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“This suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event;\n&#39;, &#39;tell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder I am\n&#39;, &#39;now to lament?”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Your family is perfectly well,” said Mr. Kirwin with\n&#39;, &#39;gentleness; “and someone, a friend, is come to visit you.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it\n&#39;, &#39;instantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my\n&#39;, &#39;misery and taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new incitement for\n&#39;, &#39;me to comply with his hellish desires. I put my hand before my eyes,\n&#39;, &#39;and cried out in agony,\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Oh! Take him away! I cannot see him; for God’s sake, do not\n&#39;, &#39;let him enter!”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Mr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance. He could not help\n&#39;, &#39;regarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in\n&#39;, &#39;rather a severe tone,\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I should have thought, young man, that the presence of your father\n&#39;, &#39;would have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“My father!” cried I, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed\n&#39;, &#39;from anguish to pleasure. “Is my father indeed come? How kind, how\n&#39;, &#39;very kind! But where is he, why does he not hasten to me?”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;My change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps he\n&#39;, &#39;thought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium,\n&#39;, &#39;and now he instantly resumed his former benevolence. He rose and\n&#39;, &#39;quitted the room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Nothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than the\n&#39;, &#39;arrival of my father. I stretched out my hand to him and cried,\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Are you then safe—and Elizabeth—and Ernest?”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;My father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured, by\n&#39;, &#39;dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my\n&#39;, &#39;desponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of\n&#39;, &#39;cheerfulness. “What a place is this that you inhabit, my son!”\n&#39;, &#39;said he, looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance\n&#39;, &#39;of the room. “You travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems\n&#39;, &#39;to pursue you. And poor Clerval—”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;The name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too\n&#39;, &#39;great to be endured in my weak state; I shed tears.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Alas! Yes, my father,” replied I; “some destiny of the\n&#39;, &#39;most horrible kind hangs over me, and I must live to fulfil it, or surely I\n&#39;, &#39;should have died on the coffin of Henry.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;We were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the\n&#39;, &#39;precarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that\n&#39;, &#39;could ensure tranquillity. Mr. Kirwin came in and insisted that my\n&#39;, &#39;strength should not be exhausted by too much exertion. But the\n&#39;, &#39;appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and I\n&#39;, &#39;gradually recovered my health.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;As my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black\n&#39;, &#39;melancholy that nothing could dissipate. The image of Clerval was\n&#39;, &#39;for ever before me, ghastly and murdered. More than once the agitation\n&#39;, &#39;into which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous\n&#39;, &#39;relapse. Alas! Why did they preserve so miserable and detested a\n&#39;, &#39;life? It was surely that I might fulfil my destiny, which is now\n&#39;, &#39;drawing to a close. Soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish these\n&#39;, &#39;throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears\n&#39;, &#39;me to the dust; and, in executing the award of justice, I shall also\n&#39;, &#39;sink to rest. Then the appearance of death was distant, although the\n&#39;, &#39;wish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat for hours\n&#39;, &#39;motionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution that\n&#39;, &#39;might bury me and my destroyer in its ruins.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;The season of the assizes approached. I had already been three months\n&#39;, &#39;in prison, and although I was still weak and in continual danger of a\n&#39;, &#39;relapse, I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country\n&#39;, &#39;town where the court was held. Mr. Kirwin charged himself with every\n&#39;, &#39;care of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence. I was spared\n&#39;, &#39;the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not\n&#39;, &#39;brought before the court that decides on life and death. The grand\n&#39;, &#39;jury rejected the bill, on its being proved that I was on the Orkney\n&#39;, &#39;Islands at the hour the body of my friend was found; and a fortnight\n&#39;, &#39;after my removal I was liberated from prison.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;My father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a\n&#39;, &#39;criminal charge, that I was again allowed to breathe the fresh\n&#39;, &#39;atmosphere and permitted to return to my native country. I did not\n&#39;, &#39;participate in these feelings, for to me the walls of a dungeon or a\n&#39;, &#39;palace were alike hateful. The cup of life was poisoned for ever, and\n&#39;, &#39;although the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of heart, I\n&#39;, &#39;saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated by\n&#39;, &#39;no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me. Sometimes\n&#39;, &#39;they were the expressive eyes of Henry, languishing in death, the dark\n&#39;, &#39;orbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed\n&#39;, &#39;them; sometimes it was the watery, clouded eyes of the monster, as I\n&#39;, &#39;first saw them in my chamber at Ingolstadt.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;My father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection. He talked\n&#39;, &#39;of Geneva, which I should soon visit, of Elizabeth and Ernest; but\n&#39;, &#39;these words only drew deep groans from me. Sometimes, indeed, I felt a\n&#39;, &#39;wish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved\n&#39;, &#39;cousin or longed, with a devouring _maladie du pays_, to see once more\n&#39;, &#39;the blue lake and rapid Rhone, that had been so dear to me in early\n&#39;, &#39;childhood; but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a\n&#39;, &#39;prison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature; and\n&#39;, &#39;these fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and\n&#39;, &#39;despair. At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the\n&#39;, &#39;existence I loathed, and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance\n&#39;, &#39;to restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Yet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finally\n&#39;, &#39;triumphed over my selfish despair. It was necessary that I should\n&#39;, &#39;return without delay to Geneva, there to watch over the lives of those\n&#39;, &#39;I so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any\n&#39;, &#39;chance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again to\n&#39;, &#39;blast me by his presence, I might, with unfailing aim, put an end to\n&#39;, &#39;the existence of the monstrous image which I had endued with the\n&#39;, &#39;mockery of a soul still more monstrous. My father still desired to\n&#39;, &#39;delay our departure, fearful that I could not sustain the fatigues of a\n&#39;, &#39;journey, for I was a shattered wreck—the shadow of a human being. My\n&#39;, &#39;strength was gone. I was a mere skeleton, and fever night and day\n&#39;, &#39;preyed upon my wasted frame.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Still, as I urged our leaving Ireland with such inquietude and impatience,\n&#39;, &#39;my father thought it best to yield. We took our passage on board a vessel\n&#39;, &#39;bound for Havre-de-Grace and sailed with a fair wind from the Irish shores.\n&#39;, &#39;It was midnight. I lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to\n&#39;, &#39;the dashing of the waves. I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my\n&#39;, &#39;sight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I should\n&#39;, &#39;soon see Geneva. The past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream;\n&#39;, &#39;yet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the detested\n&#39;, &#39;shore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly\n&#39;, &#39;that I was deceived by no vision and that Clerval, my friend and dearest\n&#39;, &#39;companion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation. I\n&#39;, &#39;repassed, in my memory, my whole life; my quiet happiness while residing\n&#39;, &#39;with my family in Geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for\n&#39;, &#39;Ingolstadt. I remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on\n&#39;, &#39;to the creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night in\n&#39;, &#39;which he first lived. I was unable to pursue the train of thought; a\n&#39;, &#39;thousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept bitterly.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Ever since my recovery from the fever, I had been in the custom of taking\n&#39;, &#39;every night a small quantity of laudanum, for it was by means of this drug\n&#39;, &#39;only that I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of\n&#39;, &#39;life. Oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes, I now\n&#39;, &#39;swallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly. But sleep did\n&#39;, &#39;not afford me respite from thought and misery; my dreams presented a\n&#39;, &#39;thousand objects that scared me. Towards morning I was possessed by a kind\n&#39;, &#39;of nightmare; I felt the fiend’s grasp in my neck and could not free\n&#39;, &#39;myself from it; groans and cries rang in my ears. My father, who was\n&#39;, &#39;watching over me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me; the dashing waves\n&#39;, &#39;were around, the cloudy sky above, the fiend was not here: a sense of\n&#39;, &#39;security, a feeling that a truce was established between the present hour\n&#39;, &#39;and the irresistible, disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm\n&#39;, &#39;forgetfulness, of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly\n&#39;, &#39;susceptible.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Chapter 22\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;The voyage came to an end. We landed, and proceeded to Paris. I soon\n&#39;, &#39;found that I had overtaxed my strength and that I must repose before I\n&#39;, &#39;could continue my journey. My father’s care and attentions were\n&#39;, &#39;indefatigable, but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and\n&#39;, &#39;sought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill. He wished me to\n&#39;, &#39;seek amusement in society. I abhorred the face of man. Oh, not\n&#39;, &#39;abhorred! They were my brethren, my fellow beings, and I felt\n&#39;, &#39;attracted even to the most repulsive among them, as to creatures of an\n&#39;, &#39;angelic nature and celestial mechanism. But I felt that I had no right\n&#39;, &#39;to share their intercourse. I had unchained an enemy among them whose\n&#39;, &#39;joy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans. How they\n&#39;, &#39;would, each and all, abhor me and hunt me from the world, did they know\n&#39;, &#39;my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me!\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;My father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by\n&#39;, &#39;various arguments to banish my despair. Sometimes he thought that I\n&#39;, &#39;felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of\n&#39;, &#39;murder, and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Alas! My father,” said I, “how little do you know me. \n&#39;, &#39;Human beings, their feelings and passions, would indeed be degraded if such\n&#39;, &#39;a wretch as I felt pride. Justine, poor unhappy Justine, was as innocent\n&#39;, &#39;as I, and she suffered the same charge; she died for it; and I am the cause\n&#39;, &#39;of this—I murdered her. William, Justine, and Henry—they all\n&#39;, &#39;died by my hands.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;My father had often, during my imprisonment, heard me make the same\n&#39;, &#39;assertion; when I thus accused myself, he sometimes seemed to desire an\n&#39;, &#39;explanation, and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of\n&#39;, &#39;delirium, and that, during my illness, some idea of this kind had presented\n&#39;, &#39;itself to my imagination, the remembrance of which I preserved in my\n&#39;, &#39;convalescence. I avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence\n&#39;, &#39;concerning the wretch I had created. I had a persuasion that I should be\n&#39;, &#39;supposed mad, and this in itself would for ever have chained my tongue. But,\n&#39;, &#39;besides, I could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my\n&#39;, &#39;hearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of\n&#39;, &#39;his breast. I checked, therefore, my impatient thirst for sympathy and was\n&#39;, &#39;silent when I would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret.\n&#39;, &#39;Yet, still, words like those I have recorded would burst uncontrollably\n&#39;, &#39;from me. I could offer no explanation of them, but their truth in part\n&#39;, &#39;relieved the burden of my mysterious woe.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Upon this occasion my father said, with an expression of unbounded wonder,\n&#39;, &#39;“My dearest Victor, what infatuation is this? My dear son, I entreat\n&#39;, &#39;you never to make such an assertion again.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I am not mad,” I cried energetically; “the sun and the heavens, who\n&#39;, &#39;have viewed my operations, can bear witness of my truth. I am the\n&#39;, &#39;assassin of those most innocent victims; they died by my machinations.\n&#39;, &#39;A thousand times would I have shed my own blood, drop by drop, to have\n&#39;, &#39;saved their lives; but I could not, my father, indeed I could not\n&#39;, &#39;sacrifice the whole human race.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;The conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were\n&#39;, &#39;deranged, and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation and\n&#39;, &#39;endeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts. He wished as much as\n&#39;, &#39;possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in\n&#39;, &#39;Ireland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my\n&#39;, &#39;misfortunes.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;As time passed away I became more calm; misery had her dwelling in my\n&#39;, &#39;heart, but I no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own\n&#39;, &#39;crimes; sufficient for me was the consciousness of them. By the utmost\n&#39;, &#39;self-violence I curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness, which\n&#39;, &#39;sometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world, and my manners\n&#39;, &#39;were calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey\n&#39;, &#39;to the sea of ice.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;A few days before we left Paris on our way to Switzerland, I received the\n&#39;, &#39;following letter from Elizabeth:\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“My dear Friend,\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“It gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle\n&#39;, &#39;dated at Paris; you are no longer at a formidable distance, and I may\n&#39;, &#39;hope to see you in less than a fortnight. My poor cousin, how much you\n&#39;, &#39;must have suffered! I expect to see you looking even more ill than\n&#39;, &#39;when you quitted Geneva. This winter has been passed most miserably,\n&#39;, &#39;tortured as I have been by anxious suspense; yet I hope to see peace in\n&#39;, &#39;your countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void of\n&#39;, &#39;comfort and tranquillity.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Yet I fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable\n&#39;, &#39;a year ago, even perhaps augmented by time. I would not disturb you at\n&#39;, &#39;this period, when so many misfortunes weigh upon you, but a\n&#39;, &#39;conversation that I had with my uncle previous to his departure renders\n&#39;, &#39;some explanation necessary before we meet.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Explanation! You may possibly say, What can Elizabeth have to explain? If\n&#39;, &#39;you really say this, my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied.\n&#39;, &#39;But you are distant from me, and it is possible that you may dread and yet\n&#39;, &#39;be pleased with this explanation; and in a probability of this being the\n&#39;, &#39;case, I dare not any longer postpone writing what, during your absence, I\n&#39;, &#39;have often wished to express to you but have never had the courage to begin.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“You well know, Victor, that our union had been the favourite plan of\n&#39;, &#39;your parents ever since our infancy. We were told this when young, and\n&#39;, &#39;taught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take\n&#39;, &#39;place. We were affectionate playfellows during childhood, and, I\n&#39;, &#39;believe, dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older. But\n&#39;, &#39;as brother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards each\n&#39;, &#39;other without desiring a more intimate union, may not such also be our\n&#39;, &#39;case? Tell me, dearest Victor. Answer me, I conjure you by our mutual\n&#39;, &#39;happiness, with simple truth—Do you not love another?\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“You have travelled; you have spent several years of your life at\n&#39;, &#39;Ingolstadt; and I confess to you, my friend, that when I saw you last\n&#39;, &#39;autumn so unhappy, flying to solitude from the society of every\n&#39;, &#39;creature, I could not help supposing that you might regret our\n&#39;, &#39;connection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of\n&#39;, &#39;your parents, although they opposed themselves to your inclinations.\n&#39;, &#39;But this is false reasoning. I confess to you, my friend, that I love\n&#39;, &#39;you and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant\n&#39;, &#39;friend and companion. But it is your happiness I desire as well as my\n&#39;, &#39;own when I declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally\n&#39;, &#39;miserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice. Even now\n&#39;, &#39;I weep to think that, borne down as you are by the cruellest\n&#39;, &#39;misfortunes, you may stifle, by the word _honour_, all hope of that\n&#39;, &#39;love and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself. I, who\n&#39;, &#39;have so disinterested an affection for you, may increase your miseries\n&#39;, &#39;tenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes. Ah! Victor, be assured\n&#39;, &#39;that your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be\n&#39;, &#39;made miserable by this supposition. Be happy, my friend; and if you\n&#39;, &#39;obey me in this one request, remain satisfied that nothing on earth\n&#39;, &#39;will have the power to interrupt my tranquillity.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Do not let this letter disturb you; do not answer tomorrow, or the\n&#39;, &#39;next day, or even until you come, if it will give you pain. My uncle\n&#39;, &#39;will send me news of your health, and if I see but one smile on your\n&#39;, &#39;lips when we meet, occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine, I\n&#39;, &#39;shall need no other happiness.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Elizabeth Lavenza.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Geneva, May 18th, 17—”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;This letter revived in my memory what I had before forgotten, the threat of\n&#39;, &#39;the fiend—“_I will be with you on your\n&#39;, &#39;wedding-night!_” Such was my sentence, and on that night would the\n&#39;, &#39;dæmon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of\n&#39;, &#39;happiness which promised partly to console my sufferings. On that night he\n&#39;, &#39;had determined to consummate his crimes by my death. Well, be it so; a\n&#39;, &#39;deadly struggle would then assuredly take place, in which if he were\n&#39;, &#39;victorious I should be at peace and his power over me be at an end. If he\n&#39;, &#39;were vanquished, I should be a free man. Alas! What freedom? Such as the\n&#39;, &#39;peasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes, his\n&#39;, &#39;cottage burnt, his lands laid waste, and he is turned adrift, homeless,\n&#39;, &#39;penniless, and alone, but free. Such would be my liberty except that in my\n&#39;, &#39;Elizabeth I possessed a treasure, alas, balanced by those horrors of\n&#39;, &#39;remorse and guilt which would pursue me until death.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Sweet and beloved Elizabeth! I read and reread her letter, and some\n&#39;, &#39;softened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal\n&#39;, &#39;dreams of love and joy; but the apple was already eaten, and the\n&#39;, &#39;angel’s arm bared to drive me from all hope. Yet I would die to make\n&#39;, &#39;her happy. If the monster executed his threat, death was inevitable; yet,\n&#39;, &#39;again, I considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate. My\n&#39;, &#39;destruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner, but if my torturer\n&#39;, &#39;should suspect that I postponed it, influenced by his menaces, he would\n&#39;, &#39;surely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge. He had vowed\n&#39;, &#39;_to be with me on my wedding-night_, yet he did not consider that\n&#39;, &#39;threat as binding him to peace in the meantime, for as if to show me that\n&#39;, &#39;he was not yet satiated with blood, he had murdered Clerval immediately\n&#39;, &#39;after the enunciation of his threats. I resolved, therefore, that if my\n&#39;, &#39;immediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my\n&#39;, &#39;father’s happiness, my adversary’s designs against my life\n&#39;, &#39;should not retard it a single hour.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;In this state of mind I wrote to Elizabeth. My letter was calm and\n&#39;, &#39;affectionate. “I fear, my beloved girl,” I said, “little happiness\n&#39;, &#39;remains for us on earth; yet all that I may one day enjoy is centred in\n&#39;, &#39;you. Chase away your idle fears; to you alone do I consecrate my life\n&#39;, &#39;and my endeavours for contentment. I have one secret, Elizabeth, a\n&#39;, &#39;dreadful one; when revealed to you, it will chill your frame with\n&#39;, &#39;horror, and then, far from being surprised at my misery, you will only\n&#39;, &#39;wonder that I survive what I have endured. I will confide this tale of\n&#39;, &#39;misery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place,\n&#39;, &#39;for, my sweet cousin, there must be perfect confidence between us. But\n&#39;, &#39;until then, I conjure you, do not mention or allude to it. This I most\n&#39;, &#39;earnestly entreat, and I know you will comply.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;In about a week after the arrival of Elizabeth’s letter we returned\n&#39;, &#39;to Geneva. The sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection, yet tears were\n&#39;, &#39;in her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks. I saw a\n&#39;, &#39;change in her also. She was thinner and had lost much of that heavenly\n&#39;, &#39;vivacity that had before charmed me; but her gentleness and soft looks of\n&#39;, &#39;compassion made her a more fit companion for one blasted and miserable as I\n&#39;, &#39;was.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;The tranquillity which I now enjoyed did not endure. Memory brought madness\n&#39;, &#39;with it, and when I thought of what had passed, a real insanity possessed\n&#39;, &#39;me; sometimes I was furious and burnt with rage, sometimes low and\n&#39;, &#39;despondent. I neither spoke nor looked at anyone, but sat motionless,\n&#39;, &#39;bewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voice\n&#39;, &#39;would soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with human\n&#39;, &#39;feelings when sunk in torpor. She wept with me and for me. When reason\n&#39;, &#39;returned, she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with\n&#39;, &#39;resignation. Ah! It is well for the unfortunate to be resigned, but for the\n&#39;, &#39;guilty there is no peace. The agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is\n&#39;, &#39;otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Soon after my arrival my father spoke of my immediate marriage with\n&#39;, &#39;Elizabeth. I remained silent.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Have you, then, some other attachment?”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“None on earth. I love Elizabeth and look forward to our union with\n&#39;, &#39;delight. Let the day therefore be fixed; and on it I will consecrate\n&#39;, &#39;myself, in life or death, to the happiness of my cousin.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“My dear Victor, do not speak thus. Heavy misfortunes have befallen\n&#39;, &#39;us, but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love\n&#39;, &#39;for those whom we have lost to those who yet live. Our circle will be\n&#39;, &#39;small but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune.\n&#39;, &#39;And when time shall have softened your despair, new and dear objects of\n&#39;, &#39;care will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly\n&#39;, &#39;deprived.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Such were the lessons of my father. But to me the remembrance of the\n&#39;, &#39;threat returned; nor can you wonder that, omnipotent as the fiend had\n&#39;, &#39;yet been in his deeds of blood, I should almost regard him as\n&#39;, &#39;invincible, and that when he had pronounced the words “_I shall be with\n&#39;, &#39;you on your wedding-night_,” I should regard the threatened fate as\n&#39;, &#39;unavoidable. But death was no evil to me if the loss of Elizabeth were\n&#39;, &#39;balanced with it, and I therefore, with a contented and even cheerful\n&#39;, &#39;countenance, agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent, the\n&#39;, &#39;ceremony should take place in ten days, and thus put, as I imagined,\n&#39;, &#39;the seal to my fate.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Great God! If for one instant I had thought what might be the hellish\n&#39;, &#39;intention of my fiendish adversary, I would rather have banished myself\n&#39;, &#39;for ever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over\n&#39;, &#39;the earth than have consented to this miserable marriage. But, as if\n&#39;, &#39;possessed of magic powers, the monster had blinded me to his real\n&#39;, &#39;intentions; and when I thought that I had prepared only my own death, I\n&#39;, &#39;hastened that of a far dearer victim.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;As the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer, whether from cowardice or\n&#39;, &#39;a prophetic feeling, I felt my heart sink within me. But I concealed my\n&#39;, &#39;feelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to the\n&#39;, &#39;countenance of my father, but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nicer\n&#39;, &#39;eye of Elizabeth. She looked forward to our union with placid contentment,\n&#39;, &#39;not unmingled with a little fear, which past misfortunes had impressed,\n&#39;, &#39;that what now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate\n&#39;, &#39;into an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Preparations were made for the event, congratulatory visits were received,\n&#39;, &#39;and all wore a smiling appearance. I shut up, as well as I could, in my own\n&#39;, &#39;heart the anxiety that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestness\n&#39;, &#39;into the plans of my father, although they might only serve as the\n&#39;, &#39;decorations of my tragedy. Through my father’s exertions a part of\n&#39;, &#39;the inheritance of Elizabeth had been restored to her by the Austrian\n&#39;, &#39;government. A small possession on the shores of Como belonged to her. It\n&#39;, &#39;was agreed that, immediately after our union, we should proceed to Villa\n&#39;, &#39;Lavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake\n&#39;, &#39;near which it stood.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;In the meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in case the\n&#39;, &#39;fiend should openly attack me. I carried pistols and a dagger\n&#39;, &#39;constantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice, and\n&#39;, &#39;by these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity. Indeed, as the\n&#39;, &#39;period approached, the threat appeared more as a delusion, not to be\n&#39;, &#39;regarded as worthy to disturb my peace, while the happiness I hoped for\n&#39;, &#39;in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixed\n&#39;, &#39;for its solemnisation drew nearer and I heard it continually spoken of\n&#39;, &#39;as an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to\n&#39;, &#39;calm her mind. But on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my\n&#39;, &#39;destiny, she was melancholy, and a presentiment of evil pervaded her;\n&#39;, &#39;and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which I had\n&#39;, &#39;promised to reveal to her on the following day. My father was in the\n&#39;, &#39;meantime overjoyed, and, in the bustle of preparation, only recognised in\n&#39;, &#39;the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;After the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my\n&#39;, &#39;father’s, but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I should commence our\n&#39;, &#39;journey by water, sleeping that night at Evian and continuing our\n&#39;, &#39;voyage on the following day. The day was fair, the wind favourable;\n&#39;, &#39;all smiled on our nuptial embarkation.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the\n&#39;, &#39;feeling of happiness. We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but we\n&#39;, &#39;were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the\n&#39;, &#39;beauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw\n&#39;, &#39;Mont Salêve, the pleasant banks of Montalègre, and at a distance,\n&#39;, &#39;surmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc, and the assemblage of snowy\n&#39;, &#39;mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the\n&#39;, &#39;opposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the\n&#39;, &#39;ambition that would quit its native country, and an almost\n&#39;, &#39;insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I took the hand of Elizabeth. “You are sorrowful, my love. Ah! If\n&#39;, &#39;you knew what I have suffered and what I may yet endure, you would\n&#39;, &#39;endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this\n&#39;, &#39;one day at least permits me to enjoy.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Be happy, my dear Victor,” replied Elizabeth; “there is, I hope,\n&#39;, &#39;nothing to distress you; and be assured that if a lively joy is not\n&#39;, &#39;painted in my face, my heart is contented. Something whispers to me\n&#39;, &#39;not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us, but I\n&#39;, &#39;will not listen to such a sinister voice. Observe how fast we move\n&#39;, &#39;along and how the clouds, which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise\n&#39;, &#39;above the dome of Mont Blanc, render this scene of beauty still more\n&#39;, &#39;interesting. Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in\n&#39;, &#39;the clear waters, where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at\n&#39;, &#39;the bottom. What a divine day! How happy and serene all nature\n&#39;, &#39;appears!”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all\n&#39;, &#39;reflection upon melancholy subjects. But her temper was fluctuating;\n&#39;, &#39;joy for a few instants shone in her eyes, but it continually gave place\n&#39;, &#39;to distraction and reverie.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;The sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance and\n&#39;, &#39;observed its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the\n&#39;, &#39;lower hills. The Alps here come closer to the lake, and we approached\n&#39;, &#39;the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary. The\n&#39;, &#39;spire of Evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the range\n&#39;, &#39;of mountain above mountain by which it was overhung.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;The wind, which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity,\n&#39;, &#39;sank at sunset to a light breeze; the soft air just ruffled the water\n&#39;, &#39;and caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the\n&#39;, &#39;shore, from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and\n&#39;, &#39;hay. The sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed, and as I touched\n&#39;, &#39;the shore I felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp\n&#39;, &#39;me and cling to me for ever.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Chapter 23\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;It was eight o’clock when we landed; we walked for a short time on the\n&#39;, &#39;shore, enjoying the transitory light, and then retired to the inn and\n&#39;, &#39;contemplated the lovely scene of waters, woods, and mountains, obscured\n&#39;, &#39;in darkness, yet still displaying their black outlines.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;The wind, which had fallen in the south, now rose with great violence\n&#39;, &#39;in the west. The moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was\n&#39;, &#39;beginning to descend; the clouds swept across it swifter than the\n&#39;, &#39;flight of the vulture and dimmed her rays, while the lake reflected the\n&#39;, &#39;scene of the busy heavens, rendered still busier by the restless waves\n&#39;, &#39;that were beginning to rise. Suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I had been calm during the day, but so soon as night obscured the\n&#39;, &#39;shapes of objects, a thousand fears arose in my mind. I was anxious\n&#39;, &#39;and watchful, while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in\n&#39;, &#39;my bosom; every sound terrified me, but I resolved that I would sell my\n&#39;, &#39;life dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that\n&#39;, &#39;of my adversary was extinguished.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence,\n&#39;, &#39;but there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her, and\n&#39;, &#39;trembling, she asked, “What is it that agitates you, my dear Victor?\n&#39;, &#39;What is it you fear?”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Oh! Peace, peace, my love,” replied I; “this night, and\n&#39;, &#39;all will be safe; but this night is dreadful, very dreadful.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I passed an hour in this state of mind, when suddenly I reflected how\n&#39;, &#39;fearful the combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife,\n&#39;, &#39;and I earnestly entreated her to retire, resolving not to join her\n&#39;, &#39;until I had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;She left me, and I continued some time walking up and down the passages\n&#39;, &#39;of the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to\n&#39;, &#39;my adversary. But I discovered no trace of him and was beginning to\n&#39;, &#39;conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the\n&#39;, &#39;execution of his menaces when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful\n&#39;, &#39;scream. It came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired. As I\n&#39;, &#39;heard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, the\n&#39;, &#39;motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could feel the blood\n&#39;, &#39;trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs. This\n&#39;, &#39;state lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated, and I rushed\n&#39;, &#39;into the room.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Great God! Why did I not then expire! Why am I here to relate the\n&#39;, &#39;destruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth? She was\n&#39;, &#39;there, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down\n&#39;, &#39;and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair. Everywhere I\n&#39;, &#39;turn I see the same figure—her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung\n&#39;, &#39;by the murderer on its bridal bier. Could I behold this and live? Alas!\n&#39;, &#39;Life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated. For a moment\n&#39;, &#39;only did I lose recollection; I fell senseless on the ground.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;When I recovered I found myself surrounded by the people of the inn; their\n&#39;, &#39;countenances expressed a breathless terror, but the horror of others\n&#39;, &#39;appeared only as a mockery, a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me. I\n&#39;, &#39;escaped from them to the room where lay the body of Elizabeth, my love, my\n&#39;, &#39;wife, so lately living, so dear, so worthy. She had been moved from the\n&#39;, &#39;posture in which I had first beheld her, and now, as she lay, her head upon\n&#39;, &#39;her arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck, I might have\n&#39;, &#39;supposed her asleep. I rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour, but\n&#39;, &#39;the deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what I now held\n&#39;, &#39;in my arms had ceased to be the Elizabeth whom I had loved and cherished.\n&#39;, &#39;The murderous mark of the fiend’s grasp was on her neck, and the\n&#39;, &#39;breath had ceased to issue from her lips.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up.\n&#39;, &#39;The windows of the room had before been darkened, and I felt a kind of\n&#39;, &#39;panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber.\n&#39;, &#39;The shutters had been thrown back, and with a sensation of horror not to be\n&#39;, &#39;described, I saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred.\n&#39;, &#39;A grin was on the face of the monster; he seemed to jeer, as with his\n&#39;, &#39;fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife. I rushed towards\n&#39;, &#39;the window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me,\n&#39;, &#39;leaped from his station, and running with the swiftness of lightning,\n&#39;, &#39;plunged into the lake.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room. I pointed to\n&#39;, &#39;the spot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with\n&#39;, &#39;boats; nets were cast, but in vain. After passing several hours, we\n&#39;, &#39;returned hopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been a\n&#39;, &#39;form conjured up by my fancy. After having landed, they proceeded to\n&#39;, &#39;search the country, parties going in different directions among the\n&#39;, &#39;woods and vines.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the\n&#39;, &#39;house, but my head whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunken\n&#39;, &#39;man, I fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; a film covered my\n&#39;, &#39;eyes, and my skin was parched with the heat of fever. In this state I\n&#39;, &#39;was carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what had\n&#39;, &#39;happened; my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that\n&#39;, &#39;I had lost.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;After an interval I arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into the room\n&#39;, &#39;where the corpse of my beloved lay. There were women weeping around; I\n&#39;, &#39;hung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no\n&#39;, &#39;distinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to\n&#39;, &#39;various subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their\n&#39;, &#39;cause. I was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror. The death\n&#39;, &#39;of William, the execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly\n&#39;, &#39;of my wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining\n&#39;, &#39;friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now\n&#39;, &#39;might be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his\n&#39;, &#39;feet. This idea made me shudder and recalled me to action. I started\n&#39;, &#39;up and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but the\n&#39;, &#39;wind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents. However, it was\n&#39;, &#39;hardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night. I hired men\n&#39;, &#39;to row and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced relief from\n&#39;, &#39;mental torment in bodily exercise. But the overflowing misery I now felt,\n&#39;, &#39;and the excess of agitation that I endured rendered me incapable of any\n&#39;, &#39;exertion. I threw down the oar, and leaning my head upon my hands, gave way\n&#39;, &#39;to every gloomy idea that arose. If I looked up, I saw scenes which were\n&#39;, &#39;familiar to me in my happier time and which I had contemplated but the day\n&#39;, &#39;before in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection.\n&#39;, &#39;Tears streamed from my eyes. The rain had ceased for a moment, and I saw\n&#39;, &#39;the fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before; they had\n&#39;, &#39;then been observed by Elizabeth. Nothing is so painful to the human mind as\n&#39;, &#39;a great and sudden change. The sun might shine or the clouds might lower,\n&#39;, &#39;but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before. A fiend had\n&#39;, &#39;snatched from me every hope of future happiness; no creature had ever been\n&#39;, &#39;so miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single in the history of\n&#39;, &#39;man.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last\n&#39;, &#39;overwhelming event? Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their\n&#39;, &#39;_acme_, and what I must now relate can but be tedious to you. Know\n&#39;, &#39;that, one by one, my friends were snatched away; I was left desolate. My\n&#39;, &#39;own strength is exhausted, and I must tell, in a few words, what remains of\n&#39;, &#39;my hideous narration.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I arrived at Geneva. My father and Ernest yet lived, but the former sunk\n&#39;, &#39;under the tidings that I bore. I see him now, excellent and venerable old\n&#39;, &#39;man! His eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their\n&#39;, &#39;delight—his Elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on with\n&#39;, &#39;all that affection which a man feels, who in the decline of life, having\n&#39;, &#39;few affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain. Cursed, cursed\n&#39;, &#39;be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste\n&#39;, &#39;in wretchedness! He could not live under the horrors that were accumulated\n&#39;, &#39;around him; the springs of existence suddenly gave way; he was unable to\n&#39;, &#39;rise from his bed, and in a few days he died in my arms.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;What then became of me? I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and\n&#39;, &#39;darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me. Sometimes,\n&#39;, &#39;indeed, I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales\n&#39;, &#39;with the friends of my youth, but I awoke and found myself in a\n&#39;, &#39;dungeon. Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear\n&#39;, &#39;conception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my\n&#39;, &#39;prison. For they had called me mad, and during many months, as I\n&#39;, &#39;understood, a solitary cell had been my habitation.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Liberty, however, had been a useless gift to me, had I not, as I\n&#39;, &#39;awakened to reason, at the same time awakened to revenge. As the\n&#39;, &#39;memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on their\n&#39;, &#39;cause—the monster whom I had created, the miserable dæmon whom I had\n&#39;, &#39;sent abroad into the world for my destruction. I was possessed by a\n&#39;, &#39;maddening rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed\n&#39;, &#39;that I might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal\n&#39;, &#39;revenge on his cursed head.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to\n&#39;, &#39;reflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about\n&#39;, &#39;a month after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town\n&#39;, &#39;and told him that I had an accusation to make, that I knew the\n&#39;, &#39;destroyer of my family, and that I required him to exert his whole\n&#39;, &#39;authority for the apprehension of the murderer.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;The magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness. “Be\n&#39;, &#39;assured, sir,” said he, “no pains or exertions on my part shall\n&#39;, &#39;be spared to discover the villain.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I thank you,” replied I; “listen, therefore, to the\n&#39;, &#39;deposition that I have to make. It is indeed a tale so strange that I\n&#39;, &#39;should fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth\n&#39;, &#39;which, however wonderful, forces conviction. The story is too connected to\n&#39;, &#39;be mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood.” My\n&#39;, &#39;manner as I thus addressed him was impressive but calm; I had formed in my\n&#39;, &#39;own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death, and this purpose\n&#39;, &#39;quieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life. I now related\n&#39;, &#39;my history briefly but with firmness and precision, marking the dates with\n&#39;, &#39;accuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued\n&#39;, &#39;he became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with\n&#39;, &#39;horror; at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted\n&#39;, &#39;on his countenance.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;When I had concluded my narration, I said, “This is the being whom I\n&#39;, &#39;accuse and for whose seizure and punishment I call upon you to exert your\n&#39;, &#39;whole power. It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope that\n&#39;, &#39;your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those\n&#39;, &#39;functions on this occasion.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;This address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own\n&#39;, &#39;auditor. He had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given\n&#39;, &#39;to a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon\n&#39;, &#39;to act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity\n&#39;, &#39;returned. He, however, answered mildly, “I would willingly afford you\n&#39;, &#39;every aid in your pursuit, but the creature of whom you speak appears to\n&#39;, &#39;have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance. Who can follow an\n&#39;, &#39;animal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where\n&#39;, &#39;no man would venture to intrude? Besides, some months have elapsed since\n&#39;, &#39;the commission of his crimes, and no one can conjecture to what place he\n&#39;, &#39;has wandered or what region he may now inhabit.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit, and if\n&#39;, &#39;he has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois\n&#39;, &#39;and destroyed as a beast of prey. But I perceive your thoughts; you do not\n&#39;, &#39;credit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the\n&#39;, &#39;punishment which is his desert.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated.\n&#39;, &#39;“You are mistaken,” said he. “I will exert myself, and if\n&#39;, &#39;it is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer\n&#39;, &#39;punishment proportionate to his crimes. But I fear, from what you have\n&#39;, &#39;yourself described to be his properties, that this will prove\n&#39;, &#39;impracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you should\n&#39;, &#39;make up your mind to disappointment.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“That cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail. My\n&#39;, &#39;revenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I\n&#39;, &#39;confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul. My rage\n&#39;, &#39;is unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned\n&#39;, &#39;loose upon society, still exists. You refuse my just demand; I have\n&#39;, &#39;but one resource, and I devote myself, either in my life or death, to\n&#39;, &#39;his destruction.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I trembled with excess of agitation as I said this; there was a frenzy\n&#39;, &#39;in my manner, and something, I doubt not, of that haughty fierceness\n&#39;, &#39;which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed. But to a Genevan\n&#39;, &#39;magistrate, whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of\n&#39;, &#39;devotion and heroism, this elevation of mind had much the appearance of\n&#39;, &#39;madness. He endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child and\n&#39;, &#39;reverted to my tale as the effects of delirium.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Man,” I cried, “how ignorant art thou in thy pride of\n&#39;, &#39;wisdom! Cease; you know not what it is you say.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate on\n&#39;, &#39;some other mode of action.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Chapter 24\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;My present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was\n&#39;, &#39;swallowed up and lost. I was hurried away by fury; revenge alone\n&#39;, &#39;endowed me with strength and composure; it moulded my feelings and\n&#39;, &#39;allowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise\n&#39;, &#39;delirium or death would have been my portion.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;My first resolution was to quit Geneva for ever; my country, which, when I\n&#39;, &#39;was happy and beloved, was dear to me, now, in my adversity, became\n&#39;, &#39;hateful. I provided myself with a sum of money, together with a few jewels\n&#39;, &#39;which had belonged to my mother, and departed.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;And now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life. I have\n&#39;, &#39;traversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships\n&#39;, &#39;which travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet. How I\n&#39;, &#39;have lived I hardly know; many times have I stretched my failing limbs upon\n&#39;, &#39;the sandy plain and prayed for death. But revenge kept me alive; I dared\n&#39;, &#39;not die and leave my adversary in being.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;When I quitted Geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which I\n&#39;, &#39;might trace the steps of my fiendish enemy. But my plan was unsettled,\n&#39;, &#39;and I wandered many hours round the confines of the town, uncertain\n&#39;, &#39;what path I should pursue. As night approached I found myself at the\n&#39;, &#39;entrance of the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my father\n&#39;, &#39;reposed. I entered it and approached the tomb which marked their\n&#39;, &#39;graves. Everything was silent except the leaves of the trees, which\n&#39;, &#39;were gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark, and the\n&#39;, &#39;scene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested\n&#39;, &#39;observer. The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to\n&#39;, &#39;cast a shadow, which was felt but not seen, around the head of the\n&#39;, &#39;mourner.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;The deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to\n&#39;, &#39;rage and despair. They were dead, and I lived; their murderer also lived,\n&#39;, &#39;and to destroy him I must drag out my weary existence. I knelt on the grass\n&#39;, &#39;and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed, “By the\n&#39;, &#39;sacred earth on which I kneel, by the shades that wander near me, by the\n&#39;, &#39;deep and eternal grief that I feel, I swear; and by thee, O Night, and the\n&#39;, &#39;spirits that preside over thee, to pursue the dæmon who caused this misery,\n&#39;, &#39;until he or I shall perish in mortal conflict. For this purpose I will\n&#39;, &#39;preserve my life; to execute this dear revenge will I again behold the sun\n&#39;, &#39;and tread the green herbage of earth, which otherwise should vanish from my\n&#39;, &#39;eyes for ever. And I call on you, spirits of the dead, and on you, wandering\n&#39;, &#39;ministers of vengeance, to aid and conduct me in my work. Let the cursed\n&#39;, &#39;and hellish monster drink deep of agony; let him feel the despair that now\n&#39;, &#39;torments me.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I had begun my adjuration with solemnity and an awe which almost assured me\n&#39;, &#39;that the shades of my murdered friends heard and approved my devotion, but\n&#39;, &#39;the furies possessed me as I concluded, and rage choked my utterance.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish\n&#39;, &#39;laugh. It rang on my ears long and heavily; the mountains re-echoed\n&#39;, &#39;it, and I felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter.\n&#39;, &#39;Surely in that moment I should have been possessed by frenzy and have\n&#39;, &#39;destroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that I\n&#39;, &#39;was reserved for vengeance. The laughter died away, when a well-known\n&#39;, &#39;and abhorred voice, apparently close to my ear, addressed me in an\n&#39;, &#39;audible whisper, “I am satisfied, miserable wretch! You have\n&#39;, &#39;determined to live, and I am satisfied.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded, but the devil\n&#39;, &#39;eluded my grasp. Suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shone\n&#39;, &#39;full upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than\n&#39;, &#39;mortal speed.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I pursued him, and for many months this has been my task. Guided by a\n&#39;, &#39;slight clue, I followed the windings of the Rhone, but vainly. The\n&#39;, &#39;blue Mediterranean appeared, and by a strange chance, I saw the fiend\n&#39;, &#39;enter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the Black Sea. I\n&#39;, &#39;took my passage in the same ship, but he escaped, I know not how.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I\n&#39;, &#39;have ever followed in his track. Sometimes the peasants, scared by\n&#39;, &#39;this horrid apparition, informed me of his path; sometimes he himself,\n&#39;, &#39;who feared that if I lost all trace of him I should despair and die,\n&#39;, &#39;left some mark to guide me. The snows descended on my head, and I saw\n&#39;, &#39;the print of his huge step on the white plain. To you first entering\n&#39;, &#39;on life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understand\n&#39;, &#39;what I have felt and still feel? Cold, want, and fatigue were the\n&#39;, &#39;least pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil\n&#39;, &#39;and carried about with me my eternal hell; yet still a spirit of good\n&#39;, &#39;followed and directed my steps and when I most murmured would suddenly\n&#39;, &#39;extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties. Sometimes,\n&#39;, &#39;when nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repast\n&#39;, &#39;was prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me. The\n&#39;, &#39;fare was, indeed, coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate, but\n&#39;, &#39;I will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I had\n&#39;, &#39;invoked to aid me. Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and\n&#39;, &#39;I was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed the\n&#39;, &#39;few drops that revived me, and vanish.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the dæmon\n&#39;, &#39;generally avoided these, as it was here that the population of the\n&#39;, &#39;country chiefly collected. In other places human beings were seldom\n&#39;, &#39;seen, and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my\n&#39;, &#39;path. I had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers\n&#39;, &#39;by distributing it; or I brought with me some food that I had killed,\n&#39;, &#39;which, after taking a small part, I always presented to those who had\n&#39;, &#39;provided me with fire and utensils for cooking.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during\n&#39;, &#39;sleep alone that I could taste joy. O blessed sleep! Often, when most\n&#39;, &#39;miserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. The\n&#39;, &#39;spirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of\n&#39;, &#39;happiness that I might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage. Deprived of\n&#39;, &#39;this respite, I should have sunk under my hardships. During the day I was\n&#39;, &#39;sustained and inspirited by the hope of night, for in sleep I saw my\n&#39;, &#39;friends, my wife, and my beloved country; again I saw the benevolent\n&#39;, &#39;countenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my Elizabeth’s\n&#39;, &#39;voice, and beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth. Often, when wearied by\n&#39;, &#39;a toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night should\n&#39;, &#39;come and that I should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest\n&#39;, &#39;friends. What agonising fondness did I feel for them! How did I cling to\n&#39;, &#39;their dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, and\n&#39;, &#39;persuade myself that they still lived! At such moments vengeance, that\n&#39;, &#39;burned within me, died in my heart, and I pursued my path towards the\n&#39;, &#39;destruction of the dæmon more as a task enjoined by heaven, as the\n&#39;, &#39;mechanical impulse of some power of which I was unconscious, than as the\n&#39;, &#39;ardent desire of my soul.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;What his feelings were whom I pursued I cannot know. Sometimes, indeed, he\n&#39;, &#39;left marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone that guided\n&#39;, &#39;me and instigated my fury. “My reign is not yet\n&#39;, &#39;over”—these words were legible in one of these\n&#39;, &#39;inscriptions—“you live, and my power is complete. Follow me; I\n&#39;, &#39;seek the everlasting ices of the north, where you will feel the misery of\n&#39;, &#39;cold and frost, to which I am impassive. You will find near this place, if\n&#39;, &#39;you follow not too tardily, a dead hare; eat and be refreshed. Come on, my\n&#39;, &#39;enemy; we have yet to wrestle for our lives, but many hard and miserable\n&#39;, &#39;hours must you endure until that period shall arrive.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Scoffing devil! Again do I vow vengeance; again do I devote thee,\n&#39;, &#39;miserable fiend, to torture and death. Never will I give up my search\n&#39;, &#39;until he or I perish; and then with what ecstasy shall I join my\n&#39;, &#39;Elizabeth and my departed friends, who even now prepare for me the\n&#39;, &#39;reward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage!\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;As I still pursued my journey to the northward, the snows thickened and the\n&#39;, &#39;cold increased in a degree almost too severe to support. The peasants were\n&#39;, &#39;shut up in their hovels, and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to\n&#39;, &#39;seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hiding-places to\n&#39;, &#39;seek for prey. The rivers were covered with ice, and no fish could be\n&#39;, &#39;procured; and thus I was cut off from my chief article of maintenance.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;The triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours. One\n&#39;, &#39;inscription that he left was in these words: “Prepare! Your toils\n&#39;, &#39;only begin; wrap yourself in furs and provide food, for we shall soon enter\n&#39;, &#39;upon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting\n&#39;, &#39;hatred.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;My courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words; I\n&#39;, &#39;resolved not to fail in my purpose, and calling on Heaven to support\n&#39;, &#39;me, I continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts,\n&#39;, &#39;until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary\n&#39;, &#39;of the horizon. Oh! How unlike it was to the blue seasons of the\n&#39;, &#39;south! Covered with ice, it was only to be distinguished from land by\n&#39;, &#39;its superior wildness and ruggedness. The Greeks wept for joy when\n&#39;, &#39;they beheld the Mediterranean from the hills of Asia, and hailed with\n&#39;, &#39;rapture the boundary of their toils. I did not weep, but I knelt down\n&#39;, &#39;and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in\n&#39;, &#39;safety to the place where I hoped, notwithstanding my adversary’s gibe,\n&#39;, &#39;to meet and grapple with him.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Some weeks before this period I had procured a sledge and dogs and thus\n&#39;, &#39;traversed the snows with inconceivable speed. I know not whether the\n&#39;, &#39;fiend possessed the same advantages, but I found that, as before I had\n&#39;, &#39;daily lost ground in the pursuit, I now gained on him, so much so that\n&#39;, &#39;when I first saw the ocean he was but one day’s journey in advance, and\n&#39;, &#39;I hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach. With new\n&#39;, &#39;courage, therefore, I pressed on, and in two days arrived at a wretched\n&#39;, &#39;hamlet on the seashore. I inquired of the inhabitants concerning the\n&#39;, &#39;fiend and gained accurate information. A gigantic monster, they said,\n&#39;, &#39;had arrived the night before, armed with a gun and many pistols,\n&#39;, &#39;putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of\n&#39;, &#39;his terrific appearance. He had carried off their store of winter\n&#39;, &#39;food, and placing it in a sledge, to draw which he had seized on a\n&#39;, &#39;numerous drove of trained dogs, he had harnessed them, and the same\n&#39;, &#39;night, to the joy of the horror-struck villagers, had pursued his\n&#39;, &#39;journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land; and they\n&#39;, &#39;conjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the\n&#39;, &#39;ice or frozen by the eternal frosts.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;On hearing this information I suffered a temporary access of despair.\n&#39;, &#39;He had escaped me, and I must commence a destructive and almost endless\n&#39;, &#39;journey across the mountainous ices of the ocean, amidst cold that few\n&#39;, &#39;of the inhabitants could long endure and which I, the native of a\n&#39;, &#39;genial and sunny climate, could not hope to survive. Yet at the idea\n&#39;, &#39;that the fiend should live and be triumphant, my rage and vengeance\n&#39;, &#39;returned, and like a mighty tide, overwhelmed every other feeling.\n&#39;, &#39;After a slight repose, during which the spirits of the dead hovered\n&#39;, &#39;round and instigated me to toil and revenge, I prepared for my journey.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I exchanged my land-sledge for one fashioned for the inequalities of\n&#39;, &#39;the Frozen Ocean, and purchasing a plentiful stock of provisions, I\n&#39;, &#39;departed from land.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I cannot guess how many days have passed since then, but I have endured\n&#39;, &#39;misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution\n&#39;, &#39;burning within my heart could have enabled me to support. Immense and\n&#39;, &#39;rugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage, and I often heard\n&#39;, &#39;the thunder of the ground sea, which threatened my destruction. But\n&#39;, &#39;again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;By the quantity of provision which I had consumed, I should guess that\n&#39;, &#39;I had passed three weeks in this journey; and the continual protraction\n&#39;, &#39;of hope, returning back upon the heart, often wrung bitter drops of\n&#39;, &#39;despondency and grief from my eyes. Despair had indeed almost secured\n&#39;, &#39;her prey, and I should soon have sunk beneath this misery. Once, after\n&#39;, &#39;the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the\n&#39;, &#39;summit of a sloping ice mountain, and one, sinking under his fatigue,\n&#39;, &#39;died, I viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye\n&#39;, &#39;caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain. I strained my sight to\n&#39;, &#39;discover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when I\n&#39;, &#39;distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-known\n&#39;, &#39;form within. Oh! With what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart!\n&#39;, &#39;Warm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that they might\n&#39;, &#39;not intercept the view I had of the dæmon; but still my sight was\n&#39;, &#39;dimmed by the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that\n&#39;, &#39;oppressed me, I wept aloud.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;But this was not the time for delay; I disencumbered the dogs of their\n&#39;, &#39;dead companion, gave them a plentiful portion of food, and after an\n&#39;, &#39;hour’s rest, which was absolutely necessary, and yet which was bitterly\n&#39;, &#39;irksome to me, I continued my route. The sledge was still visible, nor\n&#39;, &#39;did I again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short\n&#39;, &#39;time some ice-rock concealed it with its intervening crags. I indeed\n&#39;, &#39;perceptibly gained on it, and when, after nearly two days’ journey, I\n&#39;, &#39;beheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant, my heart bounded within\n&#39;, &#39;me.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;But now, when I appeared almost within grasp of my foe, my hopes were\n&#39;, &#39;suddenly extinguished, and I lost all trace of him more utterly than I had\n&#39;, &#39;ever done before. A ground sea was heard; the thunder of its progress, as\n&#39;, &#39;the waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every moment more ominous\n&#39;, &#39;and terrific. I pressed on, but in vain. The wind arose; the sea roared;\n&#39;, &#39;and, as with the mighty shock of an earthquake, it split and cracked with a\n&#39;, &#39;tremendous and overwhelming sound. The work was soon finished; in a few\n&#39;, &#39;minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy, and I was left\n&#39;, &#39;drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and\n&#39;, &#39;thus preparing for me a hideous death.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;In this manner many appalling hours passed; several of my dogs died, and I\n&#39;, &#39;myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when I saw your\n&#39;, &#39;vessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life.\n&#39;, &#39;I had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded\n&#39;, &#39;at the sight. I quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars, and\n&#39;, &#39;by these means was enabled, with infinite fatigue, to move my ice raft in\n&#39;, &#39;the direction of your ship. I had determined, if you were going southwards,\n&#39;, &#39;still to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my\n&#39;, &#39;purpose. I hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which I could pursue\n&#39;, &#39;my enemy. But your direction was northwards. You took me on board when my\n&#39;, &#39;vigour was exhausted, and I should soon have sunk under my multiplied\n&#39;, &#39;hardships into a death which I still dread, for my task is unfulfilled.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Oh! When will my guiding spirit, in conducting me to the dæmon, allow\n&#39;, &#39;me the rest I so much desire; or must I die, and he yet live? If I do,\n&#39;, &#39;swear to me, Walton, that he shall not escape, that you will seek him\n&#39;, &#39;and satisfy my vengeance in his death. And do I dare to ask of you to\n&#39;, &#39;undertake my pilgrimage, to endure the hardships that I have undergone?\n&#39;, &#39;No; I am not so selfish. Yet, when I am dead, if he should appear, if\n&#39;, &#39;the ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you, swear that he\n&#39;, &#39;shall not live—swear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated\n&#39;, &#39;woes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes. He is eloquent\n&#39;, &#39;and persuasive, and once his words had even power over my heart; but\n&#39;, &#39;trust him not. His soul is as hellish as his form, full of treachery\n&#39;, &#39;and fiend-like malice. Hear him not; call on the names of William,\n&#39;, &#39;Justine, Clerval, Elizabeth, my father, and of the wretched Victor, and\n&#39;, &#39;thrust your sword into his heart. I will hover near and direct the\n&#39;, &#39;steel aright.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Walton, _in continuation._\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;August 26th, 17—.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;You have read this strange and terrific story, Margaret; and do you not\n&#39;, &#39;feel your blood congeal with horror, like that which even now curdles\n&#39;, &#39;mine? Sometimes, seized with sudden agony, he could not continue his\n&#39;, &#39;tale; at others, his voice broken, yet piercing, uttered with\n&#39;, &#39;difficulty the words so replete with anguish. His fine and lovely eyes\n&#39;, &#39;were now lighted up with indignation, now subdued to downcast sorrow\n&#39;, &#39;and quenched in infinite wretchedness. Sometimes he commanded his\n&#39;, &#39;countenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a\n&#39;, &#39;tranquil voice, suppressing every mark of agitation; then, like a\n&#39;, &#39;volcano bursting forth, his face would suddenly change to an expression\n&#39;, &#39;of the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;His tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth,\n&#39;, &#39;yet I own to you that the letters of Felix and Safie, which he showed me,\n&#39;, &#39;and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship, brought to me a\n&#39;, &#39;greater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations,\n&#39;, &#39;however earnest and connected. Such a monster has, then, really existence!\n&#39;, &#39;I cannot doubt it, yet I am lost in surprise and admiration. Sometimes I\n&#39;, &#39;endeavoured to gain from Frankenstein the particulars of his\n&#39;, &#39;creature’s formation, but on this point he was impenetrable.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Are you mad, my friend?” said he. “Or whither does your\n&#39;, &#39;senseless curiosity lead you? Would you also create for yourself and the\n&#39;, &#39;world a demoniacal enemy? Peace, peace! Learn my miseries and do not seek\n&#39;, &#39;to increase your own.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Frankenstein discovered that I made notes concerning his history; he asked\n&#39;, &#39;to see them and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places,\n&#39;, &#39;but principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he held\n&#39;, &#39;with his enemy. “Since you have preserved my narration,” said\n&#39;, &#39;he, “I would not that a mutilated one should go down to\n&#39;, &#39;posterity.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Thus has a week passed away, while I have listened to the strangest\n&#39;, &#39;tale that ever imagination formed. My thoughts and every feeling of my\n&#39;, &#39;soul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale\n&#39;, &#39;and his own elevated and gentle manners have created. I wish to soothe\n&#39;, &#39;him, yet can I counsel one so infinitely miserable, so destitute of\n&#39;, &#39;every hope of consolation, to live? Oh, no! The only joy that he can\n&#39;, &#39;now know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and\n&#39;, &#39;death. Yet he enjoys one comfort, the offspring of solitude and\n&#39;, &#39;delirium; he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his\n&#39;, &#39;friends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or\n&#39;, &#39;excitements to his vengeance, that they are not the creations of his\n&#39;, &#39;fancy, but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a\n&#39;, &#39;remote world. This faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render\n&#39;, &#39;them to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Our conversations are not always confined to his own history and\n&#39;, &#39;misfortunes. On every point of general literature he displays\n&#39;, &#39;unbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension. His\n&#39;, &#39;eloquence is forcible and touching; nor can I hear him, when he relates\n&#39;, &#39;a pathetic incident or endeavours to move the passions of pity or love,\n&#39;, &#39;without tears. What a glorious creature must he have been in the days\n&#39;, &#39;of his prosperity, when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin! He seems\n&#39;, &#39;to feel his own worth and the greatness of his fall.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“When younger,” said he, “I believed myself destined for\n&#39;, &#39;some great enterprise. My feelings are profound, but I possessed a coolness\n&#39;, &#39;of judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements. This sentiment of\n&#39;, &#39;the worth of my nature supported me when others would have been oppressed,\n&#39;, &#39;for I deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents that\n&#39;, &#39;might be useful to my fellow creatures. When I reflected on the work I had\n&#39;, &#39;completed, no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational\n&#39;, &#39;animal, I could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors. But\n&#39;, &#39;this thought, which supported me in the commencement of my career, now\n&#39;, &#39;serves only to plunge me lower in the dust. All my speculations and hopes\n&#39;, &#39;are as nothing, and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence, I am\n&#39;, &#39;chained in an eternal hell. My imagination was vivid, yet my powers of\n&#39;, &#39;analysis and application were intense; by the union of these qualities I\n&#39;, &#39;conceived the idea and executed the creation of a man. Even now I cannot\n&#39;, &#39;recollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete. I trod\n&#39;, &#39;heaven in my thoughts, now exulting in my powers, now burning with the idea\n&#39;, &#39;of their effects. From my infancy I was imbued with high hopes and a lofty\n&#39;, &#39;ambition; but how am I sunk! Oh! My friend, if you had known me as I once\n&#39;, &#39;was, you would not recognise me in this state of degradation. Despondency\n&#39;, &#39;rarely visited my heart; a high destiny seemed to bear me on, until I fell,\n&#39;, &#39;never, never again to rise.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Must I then lose this admirable being? I have longed for a friend; I have\n&#39;, &#39;sought one who would sympathise with and love me. Behold, on these desert\n&#39;, &#39;seas I have found such a one, but I fear I have gained him only to know his\n&#39;, &#39;value and lose him. I would reconcile him to life, but he repulses the idea.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“I thank you, Walton,” he said, “for your kind intentions towards so\n&#39;, &#39;miserable a wretch; but when you speak of new ties and fresh\n&#39;, &#39;affections, think you that any can replace those who are gone? Can any\n&#39;, &#39;man be to me as Clerval was, or any woman another Elizabeth? Even\n&#39;, &#39;where the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence,\n&#39;, &#39;the companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our\n&#39;, &#39;minds which hardly any later friend can obtain. They know our\n&#39;, &#39;infantine dispositions, which, however they may be afterwards modified,\n&#39;, &#39;are never eradicated; and they can judge of our actions with more\n&#39;, &#39;certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives. A sister or a\n&#39;, &#39;brother can never, unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early,\n&#39;, &#39;suspect the other of fraud or false dealing, when another friend,\n&#39;, &#39;however strongly he may be attached, may, in spite of himself, be\n&#39;, &#39;contemplated with suspicion. But I enjoyed friends, dear not only\n&#39;, &#39;through habit and association, but from their own merits; and wherever\n&#39;, &#39;I am, the soothing voice of my Elizabeth and the conversation of\n&#39;, &#39;Clerval will be ever whispered in my ear. They are dead, and but one\n&#39;, &#39;feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life. If I\n&#39;, &#39;were engaged in any high undertaking or design, fraught with extensive\n&#39;, &#39;utility to my fellow creatures, then could I live to fulfil it. But\n&#39;, &#39;such is not my destiny; I must pursue and destroy the being to whom I\n&#39;, &#39;gave existence; then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and I may die.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;My beloved Sister,\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;September 2d.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I write to you, encompassed by peril and ignorant whether I am ever\n&#39;, &#39;doomed to see again dear England and the dearer friends that inhabit\n&#39;, &#39;it. I am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and\n&#39;, &#39;threaten every moment to crush my vessel. The brave fellows whom I\n&#39;, &#39;have persuaded to be my companions look towards me for aid, but I have\n&#39;, &#39;none to bestow. There is something terribly appalling in our\n&#39;, &#39;situation, yet my courage and hopes do not desert me. Yet it is\n&#39;, &#39;terrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered\n&#39;, &#39;through me. If we are lost, my mad schemes are the cause.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;And what, Margaret, will be the state of your mind? You will not hear of my\n&#39;, &#39;destruction, and you will anxiously await my return. Years will pass, and\n&#39;, &#39;you will have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by hope. Oh! My\n&#39;, &#39;beloved sister, the sickening failing of your heart-felt expectations is,\n&#39;, &#39;in prospect, more terrible to me than my own death. But you have a husband\n&#39;, &#39;and lovely children; you may be happy. Heaven bless you and make you so!\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;My unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion. He\n&#39;, &#39;endeavours to fill me with hope and talks as if life were a possession\n&#39;, &#39;which he valued. He reminds me how often the same accidents have\n&#39;, &#39;happened to other navigators who have attempted this sea, and in spite\n&#39;, &#39;of myself, he fills me with cheerful auguries. Even the sailors feel\n&#39;, &#39;the power of his eloquence; when he speaks, they no longer despair; he\n&#39;, &#39;rouses their energies, and while they hear his voice they believe these\n&#39;, &#39;vast mountains of ice are mole-hills which will vanish before the\n&#39;, &#39;resolutions of man. These feelings are transitory; each day of\n&#39;, &#39;expectation delayed fills them with fear, and I almost dread a mutiny\n&#39;, &#39;caused by this despair.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;September 5th.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;A scene has just passed of such uncommon interest that, although it is\n&#39;, &#39;highly probable that these papers may never reach you, yet I cannot\n&#39;, &#39;forbear recording it.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;We are still surrounded by mountains of ice, still in imminent danger\n&#39;, &#39;of being crushed in their conflict. The cold is excessive, and many of\n&#39;, &#39;my unfortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of\n&#39;, &#39;desolation. Frankenstein has daily declined in health; a feverish fire\n&#39;, &#39;still glimmers in his eyes, but he is exhausted, and when suddenly\n&#39;, &#39;roused to any exertion, he speedily sinks again into apparent\n&#39;, &#39;lifelessness.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I mentioned in my last letter the fears I entertained of a mutiny.\n&#39;, &#39;This morning, as I sat watching the wan countenance of my friend—his\n&#39;, &#39;eyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlessly—I was roused by half\n&#39;, &#39;a dozen of the sailors, who demanded admission into the cabin. They\n&#39;, &#39;entered, and their leader addressed me. He told me that he and his\n&#39;, &#39;companions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation\n&#39;, &#39;to me to make me a requisition which, in justice, I could not refuse.\n&#39;, &#39;We were immured in ice and should probably never escape, but they\n&#39;, &#39;feared that if, as was possible, the ice should dissipate and a free\n&#39;, &#39;passage be opened, I should be rash enough to continue my voyage and\n&#39;, &#39;lead them into fresh dangers, after they might happily have surmounted\n&#39;, &#39;this. They insisted, therefore, that I should engage with a solemn\n&#39;, &#39;promise that if the vessel should be freed I would instantly direct my\n&#39;, &#39;course southwards.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;This speech troubled me. I had not despaired, nor had I yet conceived\n&#39;, &#39;the idea of returning if set free. Yet could I, in justice, or even in\n&#39;, &#39;possibility, refuse this demand? I hesitated before I answered, when\n&#39;, &#39;Frankenstein, who had at first been silent, and indeed appeared hardly\n&#39;, &#39;to have force enough to attend, now roused himself; his eyes sparkled,\n&#39;, &#39;and his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour. Turning towards the men,\n&#39;, &#39;he said,\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“What do you mean? What do you demand of your captain? Are you, then,\n&#39;, &#39;so easily turned from your design? Did you not call this a glorious\n&#39;, &#39;expedition? “And wherefore was it glorious? Not because the way was\n&#39;, &#39;smooth and placid as a southern sea, but because it was full of dangers and\n&#39;, &#39;terror, because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth\n&#39;, &#39;and your courage exhibited, because danger and death surrounded it, and\n&#39;, &#39;these you were to brave and overcome. For this was it a glorious, for this\n&#39;, &#39;was it an honourable undertaking. You were hereafter to be hailed as the\n&#39;, &#39;benefactors of your species, your names adored as belonging to brave men\n&#39;, &#39;who encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind. And now,\n&#39;, &#39;behold, with the first imagination of danger, or, if you will, the first\n&#39;, &#39;mighty and terrific trial of your courage, you shrink away and are content\n&#39;, &#39;to be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and\n&#39;, &#39;peril; and so, poor souls, they were chilly and returned to their warm\n&#39;, &#39;firesides. Why, that requires not this preparation; ye need not have come\n&#39;, &#39;thus far and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove\n&#39;, &#39;yourselves cowards. Oh! Be men, or be more than men. Be steady to your\n&#39;, &#39;purposes and firm as a rock. This ice is not made of such stuff as your\n&#39;, &#39;hearts may be; it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it\n&#39;, &#39;shall not. Do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace\n&#39;, &#39;marked on your brows. Return as heroes who have fought and conquered and\n&#39;, &#39;who know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;He spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed\n&#39;, &#39;in his speech, with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism, that can\n&#39;, &#39;you wonder that these men were moved? They looked at one another and were\n&#39;, &#39;unable to reply. I spoke; I told them to retire and consider of what had\n&#39;, &#39;been said, that I would not lead them farther north if they strenuously\n&#39;, &#39;desired the contrary, but that I hoped that, with reflection, their courage\n&#39;, &#39;would return.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;They retired and I turned towards my friend, but he was sunk in languor and\n&#39;, &#39;almost deprived of life.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;How all this will terminate, I know not, but I had rather die than\n&#39;, &#39;return shamefully, my purpose unfulfilled. Yet I fear such will be my\n&#39;, &#39;fate; the men, unsupported by ideas of glory and honour, can never\n&#39;, &#39;willingly continue to endure their present hardships.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;September 7th.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;The die is cast; I have consented to return if we are not destroyed.\n&#39;, &#39;Thus are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision; I come back\n&#39;, &#39;ignorant and disappointed. It requires more philosophy than I possess\n&#39;, &#39;to bear this injustice with patience.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;September 12th.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;It is past; I am returning to England. I have lost my hopes of utility\n&#39;, &#39;and glory; I have lost my friend. But I will endeavour to detail these\n&#39;, &#39;bitter circumstances to you, my dear sister; and while I am wafted\n&#39;, &#39;towards England and towards you, I will not despond.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;September 9th, the ice began to move, and roarings like thunder were heard\n&#39;, &#39;at a distance as the islands split and cracked in every direction. We were\n&#39;, &#39;in the most imminent peril, but as we could only remain passive, my chief\n&#39;, &#39;attention was occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness increased in\n&#39;, &#39;such a degree that he was entirely confined to his bed. The ice cracked\n&#39;, &#39;behind us and was driven with force towards the north; a breeze sprang from\n&#39;, &#39;the west, and on the 11th the passage towards the south became perfectly\n&#39;, &#39;free. When the sailors saw this and that their return to their native\n&#39;, &#39;country was apparently assured, a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them,\n&#39;, &#39;loud and long-continued. Frankenstein, who was dozing, awoke and asked the\n&#39;, &#39;cause of the tumult. “They shout,” I said, “because they\n&#39;, &#39;will soon return to England.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Do you, then, really return?”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Alas! Yes; I cannot withstand their demands. I cannot lead them\n&#39;, &#39;unwillingly to danger, and I must return.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Do so, if you will; but I will not. You may give up your purpose, but\n&#39;, &#39;mine is assigned to me by Heaven, and I dare not. I am weak, but\n&#39;, &#39;surely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with\n&#39;, &#39;sufficient strength.” Saying this, he endeavoured to spring from the\n&#39;, &#39;bed, but the exertion was too great for him; he fell back and fainted.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;It was long before he was restored, and I often thought that life was\n&#39;, &#39;entirely extinct. At length he opened his eyes; he breathed with\n&#39;, &#39;difficulty and was unable to speak. The surgeon gave him a composing\n&#39;, &#39;draught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed. In the meantime he\n&#39;, &#39;told me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;His sentence was pronounced, and I could only grieve and be patient. I sat\n&#39;, &#39;by his bed, watching him; his eyes were closed, and I thought he slept; but\n&#39;, &#39;presently he called to me in a feeble voice, and bidding me come near,\n&#39;, &#39;said, “Alas! The strength I relied on is gone; I feel that I shall\n&#39;, &#39;soon die, and he, my enemy and persecutor, may still be in being. Think\n&#39;, &#39;not, Walton, that in the last moments of my existence I feel that burning\n&#39;, &#39;hatred and ardent desire of revenge I once expressed; but I feel myself\n&#39;, &#39;justified in desiring the death of my adversary. During these last days I\n&#39;, &#39;have been occupied in examining my past conduct; nor do I find it blamable.\n&#39;, &#39;In a fit of enthusiastic madness I created a rational creature and was\n&#39;, &#39;bound towards him to assure, as far as was in my power, his happiness and\n&#39;, &#39;well-being. This was my duty, but there was another still paramount to\n&#39;, &#39;that. My duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to\n&#39;, &#39;my attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or\n&#39;, &#39;misery. Urged by this view, I refused, and I did right in refusing, to\n&#39;, &#39;create a companion for the first creature. He showed unparalleled malignity\n&#39;, &#39;and selfishness in evil; he destroyed my friends; he devoted to destruction\n&#39;, &#39;beings who possessed exquisite sensations, happiness, and wisdom; nor do I\n&#39;, &#39;know where this thirst for vengeance may end. Miserable himself that he may\n&#39;, &#39;render no other wretched, he ought to die. The task of his destruction was\n&#39;, &#39;mine, but I have failed. When actuated by selfish and vicious motives, I\n&#39;, &#39;asked you to undertake my unfinished work, and I renew this request now,\n&#39;, &#39;when I am only induced by reason and virtue.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Yet I cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil\n&#39;, &#39;this task; and now that you are returning to England, you will have\n&#39;, &#39;little chance of meeting with him. But the consideration of these\n&#39;, &#39;points, and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties, I\n&#39;, &#39;leave to you; my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near\n&#39;, &#39;approach of death. I dare not ask you to do what I think right, for I\n&#39;, &#39;may still be misled by passion.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“That he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me; in\n&#39;, &#39;other respects, this hour, when I momentarily expect my release, is the\n&#39;, &#39;only happy one which I have enjoyed for several years. The forms of\n&#39;, &#39;the beloved dead flit before me, and I hasten to their arms. Farewell,\n&#39;, &#39;Walton! Seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition, even if it\n&#39;, &#39;be only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in\n&#39;, &#39;science and discoveries. Yet why do I say this? I have myself been\n&#39;, &#39;blasted in these hopes, yet another may succeed.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;His voice became fainter as he spoke, and at length, exhausted by his\n&#39;, &#39;effort, he sank into silence. About half an hour afterwards he\n&#39;, &#39;attempted again to speak but was unable; he pressed my hand feebly, and\n&#39;, &#39;his eyes closed for ever, while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed\n&#39;, &#39;away from his lips.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Margaret, what comment can I make on the untimely extinction of this\n&#39;, &#39;glorious spirit? What can I say that will enable you to understand the\n&#39;, &#39;depth of my sorrow? All that I should express would be inadequate and\n&#39;, &#39;feeble. My tears flow; my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of\n&#39;, &#39;disappointment. But I journey towards England, and I may there find\n&#39;, &#39;consolation.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I am interrupted. What do these sounds portend? It is midnight; the\n&#39;, &#39;breeze blows fairly, and the watch on deck scarcely stir. Again there\n&#39;, &#39;is a sound as of a human voice, but hoarser; it comes from the cabin\n&#39;, &#39;where the remains of Frankenstein still lie. I must arise and examine.\n&#39;, &#39;Good night, my sister.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Great God! what a scene has just taken place! I am yet dizzy with the\n&#39;, &#39;remembrance of it. I hardly know whether I shall have the power to detail\n&#39;, &#39;it; yet the tale which I have recorded would be incomplete without this\n&#39;, &#39;final and wonderful catastrophe.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I entered the cabin where lay the remains of my ill-fated and admirable\n&#39;, &#39;friend. Over him hung a form which I cannot find words to\n&#39;, &#39;describe—gigantic in stature, yet uncouth and distorted in its\n&#39;, &#39;proportions. As he hung over the coffin, his face was concealed by long\n&#39;, &#39;locks of ragged hair; but one vast hand was extended, in colour and\n&#39;, &#39;apparent texture like that of a mummy. When he heard the sound of my\n&#39;, &#39;approach, he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprung\n&#39;, &#39;towards the window. Never did I behold a vision so horrible as his face, of\n&#39;, &#39;such loathsome yet appalling hideousness. I shut my eyes involuntarily and\n&#39;, &#39;endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer.\n&#39;, &#39;I called on him to stay.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;He paused, looking on me with wonder, and again turning towards the\n&#39;, &#39;lifeless form of his creator, he seemed to forget my presence, and\n&#39;, &#39;every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some\n&#39;, &#39;uncontrollable passion.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“That is also my victim!” he exclaimed. “In his murder my\n&#39;, &#39;crimes are consummated; the miserable series of my being is wound to its\n&#39;, &#39;close! Oh, Frankenstein! Generous and self-devoted being! What does it\n&#39;, &#39;avail that I now ask thee to pardon me? I, who irretrievably destroyed thee\n&#39;, &#39;by destroying all thou lovedst. Alas! He is cold, he cannot answer\n&#39;, &#39;me.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;His voice seemed suffocated, and my first impulses, which had suggested to\n&#39;, &#39;me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his\n&#39;, &#39;enemy, were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion. I\n&#39;, &#39;approached this tremendous being; I dared not again raise my eyes to his\n&#39;, &#39;face, there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness. I\n&#39;, &#39;attempted to speak, but the words died away on my lips. The monster\n&#39;, &#39;continued to utter wild and incoherent self-reproaches. At length I\n&#39;, &#39;gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Your repentance,” I said, “is now superfluous. If you\n&#39;, &#39;had listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse\n&#39;, &#39;before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity,\n&#39;, &#39;Frankenstein would yet have lived.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“And do you dream?” said the dæmon. “Do you think that I was then\n&#39;, &#39;dead to agony and remorse? He,” he continued, pointing to the corpse,\n&#39;, &#39;“he suffered not in the consummation of the deed. Oh! Not the\n&#39;, &#39;ten-thousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the\n&#39;, &#39;lingering detail of its execution. A frightful selfishness hurried me\n&#39;, &#39;on, while my heart was poisoned with remorse. Think you that the\n&#39;, &#39;groans of Clerval were music to my ears? My heart was fashioned to be\n&#39;, &#39;susceptible of love and sympathy, and when wrenched by misery to vice\n&#39;, &#39;and hatred, it did not endure the violence of the change without\n&#39;, &#39;torture such as you cannot even imagine.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“After the murder of Clerval I returned to Switzerland, heart-broken\n&#39;, &#39;and overcome. I pitied Frankenstein; my pity amounted to horror; I\n&#39;, &#39;abhorred myself. But when I discovered that he, the author at once of\n&#39;, &#39;my existence and of its unspeakable torments, dared to hope for\n&#39;, &#39;happiness, that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me\n&#39;, &#39;he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the\n&#39;, &#39;indulgence of which I was for ever barred, then impotent envy and bitter\n&#39;, &#39;indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance. I\n&#39;, &#39;recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished. I\n&#39;, &#39;knew that I was preparing for myself a deadly torture, but I was the\n&#39;, &#39;slave, not the master, of an impulse which I detested yet could not\n&#39;, &#39;disobey. Yet when she died! Nay, then I was not miserable. I had\n&#39;, &#39;cast off all feeling, subdued all anguish, to riot in the excess of my\n&#39;, &#39;despair. Evil thenceforth became my good. Urged thus far, I had no\n&#39;, &#39;choice but to adapt my nature to an element which I had willingly\n&#39;, &#39;chosen. The completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable\n&#39;, &#39;passion. And now it is ended; there is my last victim!”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;I was at first touched by the expressions of his misery; yet, when I called\n&#39;, &#39;to mind what Frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and\n&#39;, &#39;persuasion, and when I again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my\n&#39;, &#39;friend, indignation was rekindled within me. “Wretch!” I said.\n&#39;, &#39;“It is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you\n&#39;, &#39;have made. You throw a torch into a pile of buildings, and when they are\n&#39;, &#39;consumed, you sit among the ruins and lament the fall. Hypocritical fiend!\n&#39;, &#39;If he whom you mourn still lived, still would he be the object, again would\n&#39;, &#39;he become the prey, of your accursed vengeance. It is not pity that you\n&#39;, &#39;feel; you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn\n&#39;, &#39;from your power.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Oh, it is not thus—not thus,” interrupted the being.\n&#39;, &#39;“Yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to\n&#39;, &#39;be the purport of my actions. Yet I seek not a fellow feeling in my misery.\n&#39;, &#39;No sympathy may I ever find. When I first sought it, it was the love of\n&#39;, &#39;virtue, the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being\n&#39;, &#39;overflowed, that I wished to be participated. But now that virtue has\n&#39;, &#39;become to me a shadow, and that happiness and affection are turned into\n&#39;, &#39;bitter and loathing despair, in what should I seek for sympathy? I am\n&#39;, &#39;content to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure; when I die, I am\n&#39;, &#39;well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory. Once\n&#39;, &#39;my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue, of fame, and of enjoyment. Once\n&#39;, &#39;I falsely hoped to meet with beings who, pardoning my outward form, would\n&#39;, &#39;love me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding. I was\n&#39;, &#39;nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion. But now crime has\n&#39;, &#39;degraded me beneath the meanest animal. No guilt, no mischief, no\n&#39;, &#39;malignity, no misery, can be found comparable to mine. When I run over the\n&#39;, &#39;frightful catalogue of my sins, I cannot believe that I am the same\n&#39;, &#39;creature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent\n&#39;, &#39;visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness. But it is even so; the\n&#39;, &#39;fallen angel becomes a malignant devil. Yet even that enemy of God and man\n&#39;, &#39;had friends and associates in his desolation; I am alone.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“You, who call Frankenstein your friend, seem to have a knowledge of my\n&#39;, &#39;crimes and his misfortunes. But in the detail which he gave you of them\n&#39;, &#39;he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which I endured\n&#39;, &#39;wasting in impotent passions. For while I destroyed his hopes, I did\n&#39;, &#39;not satisfy my own desires. They were for ever ardent and craving; still\n&#39;, &#39;I desired love and fellowship, and I was still spurned. Was there no\n&#39;, &#39;injustice in this? Am I to be thought the only criminal, when all\n&#39;, &#39;humankind sinned against me? Why do you not hate Felix, who drove his\n&#39;, &#39;friend from his door with contumely? Why do you not execrate the rustic\n&#39;, &#39;who sought to destroy the saviour of his child? Nay, these are virtuous\n&#39;, &#39;and immaculate beings! I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an\n&#39;, &#39;abortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on. Even now my\n&#39;, &#39;blood boils at the recollection of this injustice.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“But it is true that I am a wretch. I have murdered the lovely and\n&#39;, &#39;the helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to\n&#39;, &#39;death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing. I have\n&#39;, &#39;devoted my creator, the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and\n&#39;, &#39;admiration among men, to misery; I have pursued him even to that\n&#39;, &#39;irremediable ruin. There he lies, white and cold in death. You hate me, but\n&#39;, &#39;your abhorrence cannot equal that with which I regard myself. I look on the\n&#39;, &#39;hands which executed the deed; I think on the heart in which the\n&#39;, &#39;imagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands\n&#39;, &#39;will meet my eyes, when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Fear not that I shall be the instrument of future mischief. My work\n&#39;, &#39;is nearly complete. Neither yours nor any man’s death is needed to\n&#39;, &#39;consummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done,\n&#39;, &#39;but it requires my own. Do not think that I shall be slow to perform this\n&#39;, &#39;sacrifice. I shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me\n&#39;, &#39;thither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe; I shall\n&#39;, &#39;collect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame, that its\n&#39;, &#39;remains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would\n&#39;, &#39;create such another as I have been. I shall die. I shall no longer feel the\n&#39;, &#39;agonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied, yet\n&#39;, &#39;unquenched. He is dead who called me into being; and when I shall be no\n&#39;, &#39;more, the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish. I shall no\n&#39;, &#39;longer see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks. Light,\n&#39;, &#39;feeling, and sense will pass away; and in this condition must I find my\n&#39;, &#39;happiness. Some years ago, when the images which this world affords first\n&#39;, &#39;opened upon me, when I felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the\n&#39;, &#39;rustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds, and these were all to\n&#39;, &#39;me, I should have wept to die; now it is my only consolation. Polluted by\n&#39;, &#39;crimes and torn by the bitterest remorse, where can I find rest but in\n&#39;, &#39;death?\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Farewell! I leave you, and in you the last of humankind whom these\n&#39;, &#39;eyes will ever behold. Farewell, Frankenstein! If thou wert yet alive\n&#39;, &#39;and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me, it would be better\n&#39;, &#39;satiated in my life than in my destruction. But it was not so; thou\n&#39;, &#39;didst seek my extinction, that I might not cause greater wretchedness;\n&#39;, &#39;and if yet, in some mode unknown to me, thou hadst not ceased to think\n&#39;, &#39;and feel, thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than\n&#39;, &#39;that which I feel. Blasted as thou wert, my agony was still superior to\n&#39;, &#39;thine, for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my\n&#39;, &#39;wounds until death shall close them for ever.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“But soon,” he cried with sad and solemn enthusiasm, “I\n&#39;, &#39;shall die, and what I now feel be no longer felt. Soon these burning\n&#39;, &#39;miseries will be extinct. I shall ascend my funeral pile triumphantly and\n&#39;, &#39;exult in the agony of the torturing flames. The light of that conflagration\n&#39;, &#39;will fade away; my ashes will be swept into the sea by the winds. My spirit\n&#39;, &#39;will sleep in peace, or if it thinks, it will not surely think thus.\n&#39;, &#39;Farewell.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;He sprang from the cabin-window as he said this, upon the ice raft\n&#39;, &#39;which lay close to the vessel. He was soon borne away by the waves and\n&#39;, &#39;lost in darkness and distance.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK FRANKENSTEIN ***\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;***** This file should be named 84-0.txt or 84-0.zip *****\n&#39;, &#39;This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n&#39;, &#39;    https://www.gutenberg.org/8/84/\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\n&#39;, &#39;be renamed.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\n&#39;, &#39;law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\n&#39;, &#39;so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\n&#39;, &#39;United States without permission and without paying copyright\n&#39;, &#39;royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\n&#39;, &#39;Literary Archive Foundation\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without\n&#39;, &#39;widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\n&#39;, &#39;increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\n&#39;, &#39;freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest\n&#39;, &#39;array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n&#39;, &#39;($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\n&#39;, &#39;status with the IRS.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\n&#39;, &#39;charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\n&#39;, &#39;States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\n&#39;, &#39;considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\n&#39;, &#39;with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\n&#39;, &#39;where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\n&#39;, &#39;DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\n&#39;, &#39;state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\n&#39;, &#39;have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\n&#39;, &#39;against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\n&#39;, &#39;approach us with offers to donate.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\n&#39;, &#39;any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\n&#39;, &#39;outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation\n&#39;, &#39;methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\n&#39;, &#39;ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\n&#39;, &#39;Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\n&#39;, &#39;freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\n&#39;, &#39;distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\n&#39;, &#39;volunteer support.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\n&#39;, &#39;editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\n&#39;, &#39;the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\n&#39;, &#39;necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\n&#39;, &#39;edition.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Most people start at our website which has the main PG search\n&#39;, &#39;facility: www.gutenberg.org\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\n&#39;, &#39;including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\n&#39;, &#39;Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\n&#39;, &#39;subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;]

Alice’s Evidence\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;CHAPTER I.\n&#39;, &#39;Down the Rabbit-Hole\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\n&#39;, &#39;bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into\n&#39;, &#39;the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or\n&#39;, &#39;conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice\n&#39;, &#39;“without pictures or conversations?”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\n&#39;, &#39;hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of\n&#39;, &#39;making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\n&#39;, &#39;picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\n&#39;, &#39;close by her.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it\n&#39;, &#39;so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh\n&#39;, &#39;dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards,\n&#39;, &#39;it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the\n&#39;, &#39;time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a\n&#39;, &#39;watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried\n&#39;, &#39;on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\n&#39;, &#39;had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a\n&#39;, &#39;watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\n&#39;, &#39;field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\n&#39;, &#39;large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\n&#39;, &#39;in the world she was to get out again.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\n&#39;, &#39;dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\n&#39;, &#39;about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very\n&#39;, &#39;deep well.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\n&#39;, &#39;plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what\n&#39;, &#39;was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out\n&#39;, &#39;what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\n&#39;, &#39;looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\n&#39;, &#39;cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\n&#39;, &#39;hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she\n&#39;, &#39;passed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great\n&#39;, &#39;disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\n&#39;, &#39;of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\n&#39;, &#39;cupboards as she fell past it.\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall\n&#39;, &#39;think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me\n&#39;, &#39;at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the\n&#39;, &#39;top of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Down, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? “I wonder how\n&#39;, &#39;many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be\n&#39;, &#39;getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would\n&#39;, &#39;be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt\n&#39;, &#39;several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and\n&#39;, &#39;though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her\n&#39;, &#39;knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good\n&#39;, &#39;practice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but\n&#39;, &#39;then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had no\n&#39;, &#39;idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice\n&#39;, &#39;grand words to say.)\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Presently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right _through_\n&#39;, &#39;the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk\n&#39;, &#39;with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather\n&#39;, &#39;glad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all\n&#39;, &#39;the right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the\n&#39;, &#39;country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?”\n&#39;, &#39;(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy _curtseying_ as you’re\n&#39;, &#39;falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what\n&#39;, &#39;an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do\n&#39;, &#39;to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”\n&#39;, &#39;\n&#39;, &#39;Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\n&#39;, &#39;talking again. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!”\n&#39;, &#39;(Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at\n&#39;, &#39;tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are\n&#39;, &#39;no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s\n&#39;, &#39;very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here\n&#39;, &#39;Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a\n&#39;, &#39;dreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and\n&#39;]
