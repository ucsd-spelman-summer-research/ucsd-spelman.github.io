# Expectations

It is important to us that each undergraduate student conduct meaningful experiments, analyze results carefully, present their findings to the group on a regular basis, and read and discuss papers in the scientific literature. You will work hard in our program but you will also learn a tremendous amount, and be well situated for success in your continued education plans. There is a direct relationship between how much effort you put in, and how much you will achieve. In general, the main criteria for summer research are to conduct good science and be a good team player. Conducting research is a privilege and huge responsibility. Often we are funded through tax payer dollars. The following specific expectations apply:
 
## Time Commitment and Professional Conduct

Expect to spend 6-8 hours a day in the lab and associated program activities. You also have the opportunity to attend professional training and career advising workshops both within our department as well as through the affiliated STARS program.  

Show up at your scheduled times, ready to work! If an emergency is causing you to be late, inform your colleagues ASAP. 

### Communication 
Each lab will have their favored modes of communication and will communicate this to you. In general, a lab notebook (assigned at lab onboarding) should contain all the relevant information about what you do in the lab, so that we can understand all the steps of your protocol and exactly what you did by reading your notebook (this might be a paper notebook, or an online notebook). Record your thoughts about experiments, analysis steps, and all other research-related decisions in your notebook. Your laboratory notebook belongs to the laboratory and serves as our permanent record of what you did.

You will have weekly formal interactions with your primary faculty mentor and your direct graduate student or postdoc advisor. This is an opportunity to discuss your progress, goals, contributions to the lab environment, scientific and career development, and troubleshoot as needed.

At the end of the summer, each student will prepare a written presentation summarizing what you did, why you did it, what you learned, and what you plan to do next. You will also have the opportunity to do a short scientific presentation in front of the lab and program. More information on these can be found below.
               
### Safety and lab environment
In some labs, you may not work alone in the lab unless given direct permission by the principle investigator to do so.

Complete the required safety training and use safe techniques always. Safety requirements will vary from lab to lab, but if something doesn’t make sense, always ask.

Take your training seriously; any behavior that endangers humans or animals or the laboratory environment will not be taken lightly and may lead to your being asked to leave the lab.

## General summer schedule
Activities are listed as facilitated by UC San Diego Psychology (Psych) or the UCSD STARS program (STARS). More specifics about the STARS summer schedule can be found [here](https://grad.ucsd.edu/diversity/programs/stars/schedule1.html).

### Pre Summer Research
* February-March (Psych): Initial zoom conversations with Matched Faculty and lab will be used to introduce Spelman students.

* April-May (Psych): Begin mentorship. A minimum of 3 zoom meetings will be used to direct initial foundation readings, project design, and general mentorship. This is to ensure a smooth transition into the Summer Research Program. Program leadership will follow-up with assigned mentors to ensure compliance.
