# Principles of Community And Resources

The Department of Psychology is committed to supporting an environment where all students, post-doctoral researchers, staff, research scientists and faculty can work together without abusive or demeaning treatment. The Department of Psychology is committed to fostering an environment that:

* is free of sexual harassment
* is supportive of victims’ and survivors’ reports and rights
* does not harbor perpetrators of sexual harassment or other abuses of power
* is conducive to pursuing research in a healthy and supportive culture that fosters the free and respectful exchange of ideas from different intellectual perspectives

We are committed to upholding [UC San Diego’s Principles of Community](https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html) and expect that all members of our Department will adhere to these standards.

Anyone in our community can seek help from a variety of sources, including from individuals within and outside of the Department who undergo regular training on [University policies](http://www.ucsd.edu/catalog/front/shpp.html) and procedures.

Below we provide a list of options that may be pursued alone or in any combination depending on circumstances. This list is intended as a starting point, but anyone should feel free to contact others who they feel might better support their specific needs. CARE and CAPS provide access to confidential services and are often good places to seek information and further guidance.

* [CARE](https://students.ucsd.edu/sponsor/sarc/reporting.html) at the Sexual Assault Resource Center is the UC San Diego confidential advocacy and education office for sexual harassment, sexual violence and gender-based violence (dating violence, domestic violence, stalking). CARE provides violence prevention education for the entire UCSD campus and offers free and confidential services for students, staff and faculty impacted by sexual assault, relationship violence and stalking.

* Graduate or undergraduate students seeking independent and confidential advice can contact [Counseling and Psychology Services (CAPS)](https://caps.ucsd.edu/).  “CAPS provides FREE, confidential, psychological counseling and crisis services for registered UCSD students.  CAPS also provides a variety of groups, workshops, and drop-in forums.” They have a [reference library](https://caps.ucsd.edu/selfhelp.html) on the home page that may also be helpful, including information on student/advisor interactions. CAPS can see all currently registered students - undergraduates or graduates - and can make referrals if needed. 

* Another source of independent advice is the [Office of the Ombuds](https://ombuds.ucsd.edu/index.html). “An alternate channel for confidential, neutral, and informal dispute resolution services for the UC San Diego Community.” Their phone number is (858) 534-0777 for appointment scheduling or questions.

* [Office for the Prevention of Harassment & Discrimination (OPHD)](https://ophd.ucsd.edu/).  OPHD "works to resolve complaints of discrimination and harassment through formal investigation or alternative resolution.”  OPHD’s main phone line is (858) 534-8298 and their email is ophd@ucsd.edu. To make an online report of bias, harassment, or discrimination, please visit reportbias.ucsd.edu. Information will be kept private to the extent possible, with the caveat that full confidence can only be maintained if the issue is posed hypothetically.

* The Department of Psychiatry has developed a webpage with resources and guidance to assist individuals [responding to traumatic events](https://medschool.ucsd.edu/som/psychiatry/Pages/Traumatic-Events.aspx).

	* Student Affairs Manager, Samantha Llanos (858-534-3002, [sgllanos@ucsd.edu](mailto: sgllanos@ucsd.edu))

		* Stephan Anagnostaras (858-224-2531, [stephana@ucsd.edu](mailto: stephana@ucsd.edu))

The Department will take all reports seriously and complainants can expect:

* To be heard with respect and sympathy
* To have violations of policy reported to campus authorities for action
* To understand what the next steps are
* To be asked whether they would like follow-up contact from the person they are speaking with, if allowable by university policy

Violations of policy that are reported to the department trigger obligatory reporting. Even so, information within such reports will only be provided on a need-to-know basis. If a higher level of confidentiality is desired, complainants should consider first contacting CARE, CAPS or the office of the Ombuds for advice (see above, and contact each office for more specific information about confidentiality). When legal and University regulations require the referral of reports of potential violations, the reporter will be notified that such a disclosure is being made, and why.
