# Extracurricular Resources

The materials of this class are designed to be self-sufficient, 
however, there are many reasons why you may want to seek out 
further resources, including:
0. tools for improving your understanding
1. additional introductory practice / perspectives  
2. deeper understanding of python and computing
3. more CSS-relevant python exploration
4. more guided applications of python in other domains   

## 0. Tools for improving your understanding
- [Python Tutor](http://www.pythontutor.com/): An interactive online system for understanding how python commands are being interpreted and executed, from Phil Guo.

**Run Python online via shell / IDE** 
- [online python](https://www.online-python.com/)
- [python anywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/edvul/)
- [repl.it](https://replit.com/)
  
**Run Python online via notebooks**
- [deepnote](https://deepnote.com/dashboard)
- [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true)
- There are many more similar services, including offerings from Microsoft (Azure), Kaggle, Amazon, etc.

## 1. Alternate Introductory Python approaches:
### Programming-focused
- [python.org tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/): very concise tutorial straight from the source.
- [Think Python](https://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.html): Introduction to Programming via Python
- [Learn Python the Right Way](https://learnpythontherightway.com/): A very similar book to the above.
- [A Byte of Python](https://python.swaroopch.com/): Highly regarded online resource.
- [Python for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/html3/): Informatics focused introduction to python (although it sticks to covering Python as a language).  
- {paid} [Python crash course](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Crash-Course-2nd-Edition-dp-1593279280/dp/1593279280/ref=dp_ob_title_bk): A gentle *and* thorough introduction with fun applications at the end.
- {paid} [Learn Python 3 the Hard way](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0134692888/ref=emc_b_5_i#customerReviews): Based on a controversial, but not obviously wrong, premise that the best way to learn to code is by transcribing working code and modifying.

### Data-analysis based
- [Elements of data science](https://allendowney.github.io/ElementsOfDataScience/README.html): A Python introduction targeting data science
- [Computational and Inferential Thinking: The Foundations of Data Science](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/intro.html): A very gentle introduction to python, with an emphasis on providing a broad overview of data analysis methods.

## 2. Deeper understanding of Python and computing:

### More intensive books
- [Introduction to Computation and Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Computation-Programming-Using-Python-dp-0262542366/dp/0262542366/ref=dp_ob_title_bk): A great introduction to computation in general.  This would be most useful after you already have some familiarity, as it breezes through basic material.  
- [Fluent Python](https://www.amazon.com/Fluent-Python-Concise-Effective-Programming/dp/1491946008): An excellent book to really understand how Python works, and how to use it effectively, once you have mastered the basics.
- [Think Stats](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-stats-2e/): An introduction to statistics and exploratory data analysis assuming you already know Python.

### Style guides:
- [guide supplement](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/style/): pithy guide to writing pythonic code.  
- [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/): the official style guide  
- [google python style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) google's guide

### Official documentation
- [language reference](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html): technical, thorough, complete reference for the Python language and how it is understood by the interpreter
- [reference for standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html): covers all the built in and available-by-default functions, objects, modules, etc.
- [reference for numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html)
- [reference for pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/index.html)
- [reference for seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html)
- [reference for matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/index.html)
- [reference for statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html)
- [reference for scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html)

## 3. CSS-relevant Python resources:
- [Python companion to statistical thinking in the 21st century](https://statsthinking21.github.io/statsthinking21-python/01-IntroductionToPython.html): Introduction to modern social (particularly psychological/cognitive) science statistics, glosses over the requisite python.
- [Think complexity](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-complexity-2e/): A Python introduction to complex systems, which has many chapters on models/simulations of complex social systems.

## 4. Guided application of python in other domains:

- [Invent with Python](http://inventwithpython.com/): A collection of books guiding you through starter projects that accomplish something immediately useful, via python.  Of particular note:  
    - [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/): an introduction to python focused on interacting with objects and APIs many people have to routinely use to automate tedious tasks.  
    - [Invent your own computer games with python](http://inventwithpython.com/invent4thed/): making computer games.
