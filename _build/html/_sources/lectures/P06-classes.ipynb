Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards,\\n', 'it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the\\n', 'time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a\\n', 'watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried\\n', 'on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\\n', 'had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a\\n', 'watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\\n', 'field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\\n', 'large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\\n', '\\n', 'In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\\n', 'in the world she was to get out again.\\n', '\\n', 'The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\\n', 'dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\\n', 'about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very\\n', 'deep well.\\n', '\\n', 'Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\\n', 'plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what\\n', 'was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out\\n', 'what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\\n', 'looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\\n', 'cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\\n', 'hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she\\n', 'passed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great\\n', 'disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\\n', 'of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\\n', 'cupboards as she fell past it.\\n', '\\n', '“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall\\n', 'think nothing of tumbling down stairs!

How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk\\n', 'with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather\\n', 'glad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all\\n', 'the right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the\\n', 'country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?”\\n', '(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy _curtseying_ as you’re\\n', 'falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) “And what\\n', 'an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do\\n', 'to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”\\n', '\\n', 'Down, down, down.
