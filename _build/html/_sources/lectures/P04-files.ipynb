    "# P04: Reading and writing files\n",
    "- **Python files**: open, close, with open as fp\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading files\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding a file\n",
    "\n",
    "- Files are stored somewhere in your computer systems hard drive or storage area.\n",
    "\n",
    "- That location is specified via a file **path**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A file path encodes the location of the file within the directory structure on the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Absolute* file paths encode the location of the file relative to the root, or base directory of the file system.  So let's say we have a file named `filename.ext` located in `folder2`, which is located inside `jserences`, which is inside `Users`, which is in the base (root) directory of the file system.  On a unix machine (such as Mac OS, Linux, etc.) this location is encoded as follows `/Users/jserences/folder2/filename.ext` where the slashes (`/`) indicates directories or folders. Windows machines use the forward slash `\\`, so that path would look something like `C:\\Users\\jserences\\folder2\\filename.ext`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Relative* file paths encode the location of the file relative to the current location or path, where the program is running. So if a program has been launched in the folder `/Users/jserences/programs/`, then the relative path to `/Users/jserences/folder2/filename.ext` would involve going up one directory in the file tree using the `..` syntax, then down into `folder2` and getting `filename.ext`.  The full relative path would be `../folder2/filename.ext`.  The key part here is that `..` move you up one level in the directory tree **relative** to the the current working directory. Basically `..` is like pressing the `back` arrow on a 'Finder' window when you're moving around using the mouse and the windows provided by your operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Opening a file\n",
    "\n",
    "- Files are accessed via the `open(file, mode)` command, specifying the (relative or absolute) path to the  file, and the mode with which you want to open it ('r' for read, 'w' for write, 'a' for append, there are [more](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open)).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Opening a file creates a file object which can be read from (or written to, or appended to, depending on what mode you used to open it).  \n",
    "    - Assuming we are dealing with text files, `file.read()` reads the entire content of the file as one string. \n",
    "    - `file.readlines()` reads the entire content of the file as a list of strings, with each element corresponding to one line in the text file.  \n",
    "    - `file.readline()` reads one line at a time, and is helpful if your file is large, and you do not want to load its entirety into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you open a file, your operating system is notified that some program is doing something to that file, and it will prevent other changes from being made to that file. Consequently, it is important that you *close* the file after opening it.  In Python, the easiest way to make this that this is done without errors is via the `with` keyword, that creates a temporary context in which the file is open, and then closes the file as soon as all the operations that need to be carried out on the file are completed. Bad things can happen if you do not close the file, so make sure you're careful with this (the file might get corrupted, you might find that nothing was written to the file, etc). "
