    "Python is a programming language.  Unlike human languages, programming languages have a very strict syntax.  One virtue of this is that code written in a programming language is unambiguous -- there is only one way that Python can interpret that code.  The downside is that our intuitions from speaking human language can make it difficult to comply with a very strict syntax, semantics, vocabulary, etc. This is perhaps the hardest concept to learn when programming, but you will  get used to it with practice!"
