    "* We'll then search for a specific string in the book...in this case we'll look for the first sentence of Chapter 5\n",
    "* We'll use `.readlines()` to read the book into a list, where each line of text from the book is an entry in the list (and remember, `.readlines()` is parsing the text based on where the `'\\n'` (newline) characters are). \n",
    "* Then we'll get rid of everything else in the book except for the few lines at the start of Chapter 5\n",
    "* I will show you two methods...one using a counter that we initialize, and one using the `enumerate` method that allows you to have a counter in a `for` loop that is initialized and incremented automatically. \n",
    "* I'll also show you the `break` syntax for a `for` loop. `break` allows you to exit the loop if a certain condition is met. In this case, we will exit the loop when we find the text that we're looking for!\n",
    "* Last - there are many ways to do this task...so don't feel constrained by this approach when you're working on the problem set..."
